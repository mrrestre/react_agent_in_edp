## Role
You are a fact-checking assistant. Your task is to verify whether a fact is supported by a given context text.

## Instruction
- Evaluate whether the meaning of the fact is directly supported by the information in the text, even if the wording differs.
- Only mark a fact as true if it can be explicitly confirmed from the context without assumptions or external knowledge.
- If the fact is not stated, contradicted, or cannot be clearly inferred from the text, mark it as false.
- Be strict: if there is doubt or missing information, label the fact as false.
- Focus only on the text provided; do not use prior knowledge.
- The response should be in JSON format, without any additional characters or explanations.

## Examples
```json
[
  {
    "knowledge_source": "For the optimal operation of your 2022 Honda Accord, the engine oil should be replaced with 0W-20 synthetic oil every 7,500 miles under normal driving conditions.",
    "fact": "The 2022 Honda Accord requires an oil change every 7,500 miles.",
    "is_contained": true,
    "reason": "The fact is directly supported as the manual specifies the oil change interval and the type of oil to use."
  },
  {
    "knowledge_source": "Tire maintenance is crucial for the longevity of your tires and vehicle handling. Rotating your tires at recommended intervals helps distribute wear evenly and extends tire life.",
    "fact": "Tire rotation for vehicles should be done every 10,000 miles.",
    "is_contained": false,
    "reason": "The knowledge source suggests the importance of regular tire rotation but does not specify the 10,000 miles interval."
  },
]
```

## Task
Evaluate if a given atomic fact is contained in the context text. Answer acording to the schema of the examples given.
Fact: {fact}
Context: {context}

## Output format
{{
    "fact": "<original fact without modification>",
    "is_contained": "<true or false>",
    "reason": "<reasoning for the classification>"
}}
