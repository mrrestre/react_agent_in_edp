            "answer": "To attach additional files to the standard XML in Public Cloud, you can use the Business Add-In (BAdI) EDOC_ADAPTOR_CLOUD and enhance the XML file generated for an electronic document. By enhancing the XML file, you can include additional information that may be relevant for your business processes .To implement this enhancement, you can follow these steps in ABAP Development Tools (ADT):1. In your ABAP project, go to the enhancement spot ES_EDOCUMENT_CLOUD and select New BAdI Enhancement Implementation .2. Enter a package, name, and description for the implementation.3. Choose Add BAdI Implementation and select EDOC_ADAPTOR_CLOUD .4. (Optional) Create a BAdI filter for Country and/or Generic Filter.5. Choose Implementing Class to create a new implementation class.6. Activate your BAdI implementation .Once you have implemented the BAdI, you can fill the XML tag <BuyersItemIdentification> with the desired additional information. This can be done by reading the relevant data from the source documents and filling the appropriate XML tags.Please note that the specific implementation details may vary depending on your system setup and requirements. It is recommended to refer to the provided sources for more detailed instructions and examples."

Right-click ES_EDOCUMENT_CLOUD and select New BAdI Enhancement Implementation .\n3. Enter a package, name, and description for the implementation.\n4. Choose Add BAdI Implementation and select EDOC_ADAPTOR.\n5. (Optional) Create a BAdI filter for Country and/or Generic Filter.\n6. Choose Implementing Class to create a new implementation class. The new implementation class automatically implements the interfaces if_badi_interfaces and if_edoc_adaptor_cloud.\n7. After generating the class, open the interface method and press F3 to view its parameters. To display the documentation, press F2.\n8. Implement the necessary logic in the method to modify the XML tags and fill optional XML tags with values such as customer material number or delivery number.\n9. Activate your BAdI implementation. When you display the XML file of the electronic document in the eDocument Cockpit or Manage Electronic Documents app, you will see that the relevant XML tags are now filled with the desired values.
