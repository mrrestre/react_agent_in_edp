            "text": "The process starts when a Seller party is preparing an electronic invoice and then sends it to the Buyer. After the invoice has been validated and transported the Buyer party receives the invoice.  Once the Buyer has received the invoice in the form that it can be processed he may notify the Seller about this with an Invoice Response.  After reception, the Buyer will usually enter into the invoice reviewal and approval process. The approval process may result in the invoice being approved as is without any comments. In that case the Buyer sends an Invoice Response to the Seller to notify him that the invoice has been approved and will be paid on due date. Approval process might be a bit different for the credit note (especially as status “Paid” is not applicable, but the other statuses serve their purpose).  During the approval process, various issues may be identified. Issues such as quantities or amounts not being in line with Buyer's data, missing information to correctly handle the invoice, invoice terms not in line with agreements or contracts and so forth. Depending on the nature of the issues the Buyer may do one of the following.  * The Buyer may put the approval process on hold and notify the Seller by sending Invoice Response with status \"under query\" and add an explanation of what the issue is.     * Once the Seller has responded to the issue the acceptance process may continue or the Buyer may raise further issues. * The Buyer may conditionally approve the invoice in which case they will send an Invoice Response to the Seller with the respective status and what the conditions are.     * The Seller may respond externally, e.g. with an objection, or they may not respond in which case the Buyer will proceed and pay the invoice according to the conditions.     * Most common example is when an invoice has payment terms like due date or payment account that are not in line with a contract.     * Then the Buyer may notify that the invoice will be paid in accordance to the contract and then proceed to do so unless the Seller objects. * The Buyer may reject the invoice in which case it will notify the Seller and state the reason for the rejection and possibly request a credit note.     * This is a final status for the invoice so if the Seller does not agree with the rejection they must follow that up externally.  If an invoice has been approved or conditionally approved the Buyer will in due time proceed to initiate payment. The Buyer may then notify the Seller that the payment has been initiated."

            "text": "Key information in an Invoice Response is the reporting of the status of the invoice. The objective of the status code is to provide the Seller with a clear indication of the status of the referenced invoice inside the Buyers process in a way that allows the Seller to clearly identify if an action is required on his behalf. The status code can be supplemented with a clarification or an action code or textual note that explains the status and assists the Seller in deciding on correct reaction.  The codes in the Invoice Response are given in the following structure.  * Invoice Status (1..1) 'cac:DocumentResponse/Response/cbc:ResponseCode'  Each Invoice Response must have one and only one status code. For each Invoice Response (status) there is the option of providing one or more clarification. For each clarification there is the option to provide data that the Buyer proposes as a correction.  Example 1. Example An invoice may have been put under query (status UQ), as clarification the code XYZ is given to indicate that there is an issue with the references in the invoice. As data the Invoice Response may state that the expected value for the Purchase Order reference in the invoice was PO123."

            "text": "The following policies apply to the use of status codes:  * List of Status codes is fixed and can not be changed bilaterally. * There are seven pre-agreed status codes (main statuses). * Status code is sent from Buyer to Seller to inform the Seller about further processing of the invoice on Buyer side. * Status code does not inform the business reason for the Status to the Seller (there is a clarification code for that). * Every status can be the first status sent to the Seller but from there further statuses must follow a defined order (see [Invoice Response process rules](invoice-response-process-rules), rule OP-BR111-R012). * Maximum time for first response 3 days - The Seller should receive the first Invoice Response within 3 working days.     * By receiving the first Response message the Seller will know that an Invoice has been received by the Buyer and what its status is.     * However, if the Seller does not receive any response he should wait 3 working days before contacting the Buyer to query whether the Invoice was received.     * A Buyer who has received an invoice should therefore provide a first Response before that time to notify the Seller that it has been received and what its status is. * The minimum set of Statuses that must be supported by a Buyer is “Message acknowledged”, “Rejected” and “Approved”.  Table 3. The Status codes used in an Invoice Response message are defined in the below table and are a subset UNECE code list 4343 with additional codes.  * Status Code: AB   * UNECE name: Message acknowledgement   * UNECE definition: Indicates that an acknowledgement relating to receipt of message or transaction is required.   * BIS usage: Status is used when Buyer has received a readable invoice message that can be understood and submitted for processing by the Buyer.   * Response expected: NO   * Clarification Required: NO   * Mandatory: YES   * Final: NO * Status Code: IP   * UNECE name: In Process   * UNECE definition: Indicates that the referenced message or transaction is being processed.   * BIS usage: Status is used when the processing of the Invoice has started in Buyers system.   * Response expected: NO   * Clarification Required: NO   * Mandatory: NO   * Final: NO * Status Code: UQ   * UNECE name: Under query   * UNECE definition: Indicates that the processing of the referenced message has been halted pending response to a query.   * BIS usage: Status is used when Buyer will not proceed to accept the Invoice without receiving additional information from the Seller.   * Response expected: YES   * Clarification Required: YES   * Mandatory: NO   * Final: NO * Status Code: CA   * UNECE name: Conditionally accepted   * UNECE definition: Indication that the referenced offer or transaction (e.g., cargo booking or quotation request) has been accepted under conditions indicated in this message.   * BIS usage: Status is used when Buyer is accepting the Invoice under conditions stated in 'Status Reason' and proceed to pay accordingly unless disputed by Seller.   * Response expected: NO[2]   * Clarification Required: YES   * Mandatory: NO   * Final: NO * Status Code: RE   * UNECE name: Rejected   * UNECE definition: Indication that the referenced offer or transaction (e.g., cargo booking or quotation request) is not accepted.   * BIS usage: Status is used only when the Buyer will not process the referenced Invoice any further.Buyer is rejecting this invoice but not necessarily the commercial transaction.Although it can be used also for rejection for commercial reasons (invoice not corresponding to delivery).   * Response expected: YES   * Clarification Required: YES   * Mandatory: YES   * Final: YES * Status Code: AP   * UNECE name: Accepted   * UNECE definition: Indication that the referenced offer or transaction (e.g., cargo booking or quotation request) has been accepted.   * BIS usage: Status is used only when the Buyer has given a final approval of the invoice and the next step is payment   * Response expected: NO   * Clarification Required: NO   * Mandatory: YES   * Final: NO * Status Code: PD with PPD (1)   * UNECE name: Partially Paid   * UNECE definition: Indicates that the referenced document or transaction has been partially paid.   * BIS usage: Status is used together with Clarification Reason code PPD, only when the Buyer has initiated the payment of the invoice without having paid the accepted amount in full.   * Response expected: NO   * Clarification Required: NO   * Mandatory: NO   * Final: NO * Status Code: PD   * UNECE name: Fully Paid   * UNECE definition: Indicates that the referenced document or transaction has been paid.   * BIS usage: Status is used only when the Buyer has initiated the payment of the invoice.   * Response expected: NO   * Clarification Required: NO   * Mandatory: NO   * Final: YES   (1) Status code PD (Paid) together with Clarification Reason code PPD (Partially Paid) is the case when an invoice is partially paid with the intention of later paying the full invoice amount as was accepted.  The sequence of the status codes is fixed to allow the Seller, as receiver of the Invoice Response message, to advance the status of the invoice in his systems in an orderly way. See [Invoice Response process rules](invoice-response-process-rules). This requires the Buyer to be conservative in reporting status and only advance an invoice when the status is reasonably certain.  The status of an invoice must advance in the following sequence, but any status may be the first one used or may be omitted.  1.  AB - Message acknowledgement 2.  IP - In process 3.  UQ - Under query (may be repeated before moving forward) 4.  CA - Conditionally accepted 5.  RE - Rejected 6.  AP - Accepted 7.  PD - Paid, can be in steps, partially paid and then paid.  Example 2. Examples of status advancement: 1.  If an invoice is paid right after being received, the Buyer can report with a single Invoice Response using the code PD. 2.  If an invoice has been put under query then following the response from the Seller, the Buyer may advance it to any of the following codes:      |CA |conditionally accepted| |---|----------------------| |RE |Rejected              | |AP |Accepted              | |PD |Paid                  |  Deviations from this sequence must be handled manually between the trading parties. As example, if a Buyer has stated that an invoice has been accepted they can not later send an Invoice Response indicating that it is under query or rejected. This does however not prohibit the Buyer from changing his decision, but he must report that to the Seller by other means than by using an Invoice Response.  The fixed order simplifies the automation of the processing for the receiver of the Invoice Response."

            "title": " 3.4.2. Clarification",
            "text": "Depending on the status code, a clarification may be needed to state the Buyer's reason for the status and/or any expected action from the Seller's side. The clarification may be given either as text (in Status Reason) or as code (in StatusReasonCode). The purpose of the clarification is to provide the Seller with structured information which enables him to partially or fully automate his processing. The clarifications are of two types.  * Reasons for the given status. * Actions that the Buyer requests from the Seller.  These two types of clarifications are contained in separate code lists that have different list identifiers. This allows the Seller to distinguish between the two types of clarifications. Clarification codes are defined in [Code list section](https://docs.peppol.eu/poacc/upgrade-3/codelist/).  Similar business reason (for example missing order number) may trigger different statuses depending on the Buyer's business process. (e.g. missing order number - some of the Buyers might 'Reject' the invoice but some of the Buyers might put it 'Under query').   Detail type codes and values  For each clarification code the Buyer can provide details to assist in the correction. For example, if an invoice contains the wrong Buyers TAX number then the Buyer can provide the correct number in the Invoice Response. When a textual clarification that includes information about the correct values is not sufficient, but the correct values need to be provided in a structured way that information can be given by providing a type code that identifies the information type and the correct value.  The detail type code for each data type shall be the business term identifier of the referenced document that shall be corrected, and the detail value shall be the value that the Buyer proposes as the correct one.  Example: A Buyer receives a Peppol invoice where the following is true * The invoice complies to Peppol Billing specification * The Buyer's TAX number in the invoice is incorrect and should be EU12345 * The Buyer requests the Seller to send a credit note to cancel the incorrect invoice and issue a new invoice with the correct TAX number."

If the status of that Invoice changes the respective change must be reported with another Invoice Response.  The status clarification for the given status can be of either or both of two types - reason of that status and/or action expected by Seller. The purpose of this is to help Seller to understand the status and to resolve it in the correct way.  As example if an invoice is rejected it will be represented as status code RE (Rejected) in the Invoice Response. For clarification, the Invoice Response would then state why it is rejected and there may be more than one reason. The clarification may further give the instructions regarding actions expected from the Seller, for example to cancel the Invoice with a Credit Note and issue a new corrective Invoice.
