To solve this issue, implement the last version of the SAP Note 2440686 (eDoc EU AIF Customizing), and upload and activate the latest version of the BC Set in your system. The BC Set is attached to the SAP Note. After this, review all the configuration inside the topic Integrating Peppol Exchange with SAP S/4HANA and SAP ERP. It is important to ensure that a certificate was correctly uploaded to the Connection Management app in the Peppol dashboard, and that client certificate is valid in SOAMANAGER. As an alternative, remove the certificate in Connection Management app and upload it again. After that, test the same scenario again. See Creating Logical Ports in SOA Management.

      "\n",
      "1. **Export the Certificate:**\n",
      "   - Use the SAP Trust Manager (transaction STRUST) to export the public certificate. The recommended formats for export are `.cer` or `.crt`.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Certificate Format:**\n",
      "   - The certificate should be in DER encoded binary X.509 format or Base64 format, which are commonly used for authentication purposes.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Configuration:**\n",
      "   - Ensure the certificate is correctly uploaded to the Connection Management app in the Peppol dashboard and validated in SOAMANAGER.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Additional Resources:**\n",
      "   - Review SAP Notes 2783795 and 2440686 for detailed installation and configuration guidance.\n",
      "\n",
      "By following these steps, you should be able to obtain and configure the necessary client certificate for your integration task. If further issues arise, consulting the SAP Help documentation and relevant SAP Notes will provide additional support.\n"
