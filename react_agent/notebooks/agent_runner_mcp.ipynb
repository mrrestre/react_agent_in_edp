      "The Invoice List functionality is not in the scope of electronic documents for countries using Peppol. You must generate electronic documents based in separate invoices. Note that you can submit this idea and/or improvement requests via Customer Influence program. This is the channel where customers can influence the development. See the SAP Note 11 (Shape and influence releases of products).\n",
      "You can exchange invoices among with companies in countries/region that use the Peppol network. Additionally, if you want to send an electronic document to a company in another country/region that accepts the XML files in the format BIS 3, you can use the Party ID Type 'GLN'. For example, a company in Sweden sends invoices to a company in Spain. The receiver companies for cross-border invoicing can use VAT ID as Peppol participant ID and the details are in the SAP Note 3013311 (eDoc EU Corrections). For more information, see Party ID Types for Receivers by Country/Region.\n",
      "The proforma invoices can be sent to specific customers, when there is an agreement to temporarily not pay specific bills. For Peppol countries, the electronic invoice process is enabled for SD invoices with FI accounting document only. In this case, you can post Free Of Goods with 100% discount, which will not influence ledger book anyway. Or you can include Free Of Goods in another invoice line, whose amount must be posted to customer GL. The solution supports Free Of Goods with 100% discount and inactive conditions, but the document should be posted to FI. See Assigning eDocument Type to Billing Document Type.\n",

      "### Insights:\n",
      "Based on the retrieved information, here are the key points regarding extending an eDocument customer invoice process for Public Cloud customers in Spain:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Peppol Network Usage**: Spain uses the Peppol network for exchanging invoices. You can generate electronic documents based on separate invoices, but the Invoice List functionality is not within the scope for countries using Peppol.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Cross-Border Invoicing**: You can exchange invoices with companies in other countries that use the Peppol network. For cross-border invoicing, the VAT ID can be used as the Peppol participant ID.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Influence Development**: Customers can submit ideas or improvement requests through the Customer Influence program to shape and influence product releases.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Proforma Invoices**: These can be sent to specific customers under certain agreements, such as temporarily not paying specific bills.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **SD Invoices with FI Accounting**: The electronic invoice process is enabled for SD invoices with FI accounting documents only. Free Of Goods can be posted with a 100% discount without influencing the ledger book.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Conclusion:\n",
      "As a Public Cloud customer in Spain, you can extend your eDocument customer invoice process by leveraging the Peppol network for cross-border invoicing and submitting improvement requests through the Customer Influence program. Ensure that your invoices comply with the Peppol standards and consider using the VAT ID as the Peppol participant ID for cross-border transactions. Additionally, you can manage proforma invoices and SD invoices with FI accounting documents as part of your process extension.\n"
