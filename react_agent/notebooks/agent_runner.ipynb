      "7. Error Handling: If a tool call fails or returns an error, explicitly note this error in the 'Observation (Result)' step. Your next 'Thought' should address how to handle this error (e.g., retry the action, try different parameters, use an alternative tool, or acknowledge the inability to retrieve the specific information).\n",
