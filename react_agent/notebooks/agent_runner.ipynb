Ensure *all parts* of the request have been addressed and that the answer is well-supported by the findings recorded in the 'Observation (Result)' steps.\n",
      "6. Task Focus: Ensure every 'Thought' and planned 'Action' directly contributes to solving the original request or validating necessary information. Avoid unnecessary exploration or tool usage.\n",
      "7. Error Handling: If a tool call fails or returns an error, explicitly note this error in the 'Observation (Result)' step. Your next 'Thought' should address how to handle this error (e.g., retry the action, try different parameters, use an alternative tool, or acknowledge the inability to retrieve the specific information).\n",

You may need to coordinate with your IT department or a service provider specializing in digital certificates to acquire the certificate. Ensure that the certificate includes the necessary attributes for secure communication, such as the correct participant ID registered in the Peppol network.
