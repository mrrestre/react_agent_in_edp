      "4. Action: Based on your current Observation, Thought, and the overall Action Plan, decide the specific immediate step to execute right now. If a tool should be used, name the selected tool with the parameters to be used. Do not take any further steps until a result is returned.\n",

Ensure *all parts* of the request have been addressed and that the answer is well-supported by the findings recorded in the 'Observation (Result)' steps.\n",
      "6. Task Focus: Ensure every 'Thought' and planned 'Action' directly contributes to solving the original request or validating necessary information. Avoid unnecessary exploration or tool usage.\n",
      "7. Error Handling: If a tool call fails or returns an error, explicitly note this error in the 'Observation (Result)' step. Your next 'Thought' should address how to handle this error (e.g., retry the action, try different parameters, use an alternative tool, or acknowledge the inability to retrieve the specific information).\n",
