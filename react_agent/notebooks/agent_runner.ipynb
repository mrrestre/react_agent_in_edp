Both the back end system (SAP ERP or SAP S/4HANA) and the Peppol Exchange must have the correct authorization objects to process incoming responses and invoices. See Connecting System to Service, check the Parameter Name 'User' in the connection details table. After that, ensure that all manual implementation steps from the SAP Note 2949379 (eDoc Peppol Configuration and Customizing) are correctly followed in your system.\n",
      "The onboarding steps are described in the Onboarding for Peppol Exchange. The onboarding to start working with the Peppol Exchange service is usually assisted by the Account Executive. If you don't know who your Account Executive is, follow the instructions in the content of the SAP Note 2626344 (Who is the SAP Account Executive for my company). You need to contact this person to see the next steps on how to subscribe the service. After the Account Executive actions, you receive two emails for each account type (test and production) with a request for you to create credentials that you sue to access the service.\n",
      "Ensure that you have assigned the role to the S-User using the button 'Manage Subaccount User', inside the 'Connection Management' of the Peppol Exchange service.

Additionally, authorization objects must be correctly set up in both the SAP system and Peppol Exchange.\n",
