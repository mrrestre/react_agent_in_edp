      "1. **Enhance the ABAP Logic:**\n",
      "   - In class `cl_edocument_fr_inv_ci` (or its parent), update the `is_relevant` method to include the new source type for settlement management documents. For example:\n",
      "     ```abap\n",
      "     IF mo_source->mv_source_type = cl_edoc_source_stlmt_invoice=>gc_src_stlmt_invoice.\n",

      "       RETURN.\n",
      "     ENDIF.\n",
      "     ```\n",
      "   - Ensure this check is added alongside existing source type checks.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Configuration Steps:**\n",
      "   - Go to the configuration activity: **Assign eDocument Type to Settlement Document Type**.\n",
      "   - For France, assign the relevant eDocument type (e.g., `FR_INV` for invoices, `FR_CRE` for credit notes) to your settlement management document types.\n",
      "   - Save your entries.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Example Table Entry:**\n",
      "| Settlement Document Type | eDocument Type | Description         |\n",
      "|-------------------------|---------------|---------------------|\n",
      "| (Your SM Doc Type)      | FR_INV        | France Invoice      |\n",
      "| (Your SM Doc Type)      | FR_CRE        | France Credit Memo  |\n",
      "\n",
      "**Plain-Language Summary:**  \n",
      "You need to both update the ABAP code to recognize settlement management documents as relevant for eDocument processing and configure the system so that these document types are mapped to the correct eDocument types for France. This ensures that when a settlement management document is posted, an eDocument is automatically created and processed.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Limitations:**  \n",
      "- The exact source type constant for settlement management must match your system's implementation.\n",
      "- Additional BAdI or custom logic may be needed if your process has further requirements.\n"
