      "Agent Answer: To attach additional files to standard XML in SAP Document and Reporting Compliance, Cloud Edition (DRCce), you can follow these steps:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Prerequisites:\n",
      "   - Ensure that the legal format and the authority's platforms support handling attachments.\n",
      "   - Create your attachment and add it to the attachment list of the relevant source document.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Implementation:\n",
      "   Use the Business Add-In (BAdI) EDOC_ADAPTOR_CLOUD and its method SET_OUTPUT_DATA to add attachments to the XML file. Here's how:\n",
      "\n",
      "   a. In the SAP S/4HANA Cloud, ABAP environment, implement the BAdI EDOC_ADAPTOR_CLOUD.\n",
      "   b. In the SET_OUTPUT_DATA method, add the attachment data to the ADDITIONAL_DOCUMENT_REFERENCE table of the XML_FILE_MODIFIED parameter.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Procedure:\n",
      "   a. Go to transaction SE18 and search for BAdI EDOC_ADAPTOR.\n",
      "   b. Set the GENERIC_FILTER parameter for the BAdI implementation as INVOICE.\n",
      "   c. Configure the COUNTRY filter with your specific country code.\n",
      "   d. Implement the SET_OUTPUT_DATA method to read attachments from the attachment list of a source document and add them to the XML file.\n",

      "- This feature is specific to SAP Document and Reporting Compliance, Cloud Edition.\n",
      "- The ability to attach files depends on the legal format and authority platform support.\n",
      "- You need to implement the BAdI EDOC_ADAPTOR_CLOUD and its SET_OUTPUT_DATA method.\n",
      "- Attachments are added to the ADDITIONAL_DOCUMENT_REFERENCE table in the XML structure.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Judge Reasoning: The generated answer provides a mostly accurate and detailed explanation of how to attach additional files to standard XML in SAP Public Cloud. It correctly identifies the use of the EDOC_ADAPTOR_CLOUD BAdI and its SET_OUTPUT_DATA method as the primary mechanism for this task. The answer also includes relevant prerequisites, implementation steps, and a code snippet that illustrates the general approach.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, there are a few points that make the answer partially helpful rather than fully helpful:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. The specific implementation details and code snippet provided in the answer couldn't be directly verified in the available ABAP codebase. While the general approach seems correct, the exact method implementation may vary in different SAP systems or customizations.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. The answer doesn't mention potential variations or limitations that might exist in different SAP Public Cloud environments or for different document types.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. The explanation could benefit from more context about when and why one might need to attach additional files to standard XML, and any potential impacts on document processing or compliance.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. The answer doesn't address potential error handling or best practices for implementing this functionality in a production environment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite these limitations, the answer provides a solid starting point for a developer or SAP consultant to implement the requested functionality. It outlines the key steps and components involved in attaching additional files to standard XML in SAP Public Cloud, which aligns with the available documentation and ABAP class structures found in the codebase search.\n",
