      "The markdown content provides detailed procedures and technical information related to uploading client certificates in SAP systems, specifically focusing on SAP S/4HANA Cloud and its integration with external systems. The user's query about the client certificate upload format in Electronic Document Processing (EDP) is addressed through various sections that describe the formats and steps involved in uploading client certificates.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Key Technical Elements Related to Client Certificate Upload:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Certificate Formats:**\n",
      "   - The client certificate can be exported in X.509 Certificate (.pem) format.\n",
      "   - The root certificate can be extracted from the client certificate in Base-64-encoded X.509 certificate (.crt) format.\n",
      "   - Other supported formats for digital certificates include PKCS #12, JKS, PFX, and P12.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **SAP Fiori Launchpad and Apps:**\n",
      "   - The app \"Maintain Client Certificate\" is used to manage client certificates within SAP S/4HANA Cloud.\n",
      "   - The app \"Maintain Communication Users\" (F1338) is used for creating inbound communication users and uploading certificates.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Procedure for Uploading Client Certificates:**\n",
      "   - **Exporting Client Certificate:**\n",
      "     - Open the \"Maintain Client Certificate\" app.\n",
      "     - Export the client certificate in .pem format.\n",
      "   - **Extracting Root Certificate:**\n",
      "     - Export the client certificate in .crt format.\n",
      "     - Extract the root certificate using system-specific methods (Windows or Mac).\n",
      "   - **Uploading to SAP AEM Broker:**\n",
      "     - Use the SAP AEM broker UI console to add client certificate authority.\n",
      "     - Provide a certificate authority name and paste the client certificate content.\n",
      "     - Enable client certificate authentication in the AEM broker.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Handling Certificate Renewal:**\n",
      "   - The default client certificate is valid for one year, and renewal begins 89 days before expiration.\n",
      "   - New certificates are issued 30 days before expiration, requiring updates in communication systems.\n",
      "   - The process involves downloading the new certificate and updating the trust store of external systems.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Creating Communication Users:**\n",
      "   - Log on to SAP S/4HANA Cloud as a Configuration Expert.\n",
      "   - Use the \"Maintain Communication Users\" app to create new users and upload certificates.\n",
      "   - Select the appropriate public client certificate for upload.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Managing Digital Certificates:**\n",
      "   - The app \"Manage Digital Certificates\" is used for uploading, updating, and deleting certificates.\n",
      "   - It supports integration with SAP Document and Reporting Compliance, particularly for Brazil's outbound invoicing.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Configuration Steps and SAP Components:\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Exporting Certificates:**\n",
      "  - Use the \"Maintain Client Certificate\" app to export certificates in required formats.\n",
      "  \n",
      "- **Uploading Certificates:**\n",
      "  - Use the \"Maintain Communication Users\" app (F1338) for uploading certificates.\n",
      "  - Use the SAP AEM broker UI console for uploading client and root certificates.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Certificate Renewal Process:**\n",
      "  - Monitor certificate expiration and renewal notifications.\n",
      "  - Update communication systems with new certificates using the \"Maintain Client Certificates\" app.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Technical Objects and SAP Notes:**\n",
      "  - The procedures involve specific apps and UI consoles within SAP systems.\n",
      "  - SAP Notes or documentation links are provided for further configuration details.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Implementation Hints:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Ensure the correct format is selected when exporting and uploading certificates.\n",
      "- Regularly check for certificate expiration notifications and plan for timely renewals.\n",
      "- Verify the common name (CN) of the client certificate matches the client username in the AEM broker.\n",
      "- Use the appropriate app for managing certificates based on the integration scenario (e.g., outbound invoicing for Brazil).\n",
      "\n",
