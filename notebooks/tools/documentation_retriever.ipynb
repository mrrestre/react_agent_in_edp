      "1. **Generate a Certificate in SAP BTP**: \n",
      "   - Navigate to the BTP Subaccount and go to Connectivity -> Destination -> Certificates.\n",
      "   - Choose \"Generate New Certificate\" and provide a meaningful name for the certificate.\n",
      "   - Select the file extension \"PFX\" and remember the password you set during this process.\n",
      "   - Select the new certificate in your destination to the backend system and provide authentication settings such as \"Internet\" and \"ClientCertificateAuthentication\".\n",
      "   - Ensure your certificate is selected in the \"Key Store Location\" and save the destination [[1]](https://drcce-architecture-ai.b217766.stage.kyma.ondemand.com/api/v1/forward_to_source?source_url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.wdf.sap.corp%2Fslh-dc-platform%2Fpeppol-service-support-documentation%2Fblob%2Fmain%2Fsrc%2Fmd%2FPush%2520Response%2520is%2520not%2520received%2520or%2520processed%2520in%2520the%2520Backend.md%23communication-directions-and-certificates&response_session_id=c00f5824-a6c3-427f-ba19-309fd86eaa45&chunk_id=7a7f1814-ff5f-429b-8dc7-05890e161823&is_inline_source=True).\n",
