      "The onboarding steps are described in the Onboarding for Peppol Exchange. The onboarding to start working with the Peppol Exchange service is usually assisted by the Account Executive. If you don't know who your Account Executive is, follow the instructions in the content of the SAP Note 2626344 (Who is the SAP Account Executive for my company). You need to contact this person to see the next steps on how to subscribe the service. After the Account Executive actions, you receive two emails for each account type (test and production) with a request for you to create credentials that you sue to access the service.\n",
      "After you implement the SAP Notes 3042934 (eDoc EU Corrections) and 3057837 (BP customizing for generic Peppol Participant ID), the scheme 'EU:NAL' is supported for all Peppol countries/regions.\n",
      "This error is displayed when the user is missing the authorization objects. Both the back end system (SAP ERP or SAP S/4HANA) and the Peppol Exchange must have the correct authorization objects to process incoming responses and invoices. See Connecting System to Service, check the Parameter Name 'User' in the connection details table. After that, ensure that all manual implementation steps from the SAP Note 2949379 (eDoc Peppol Configuration and Customizing) are correctly followed in your system.\n",
      "You can exchange invoices among with companies in countries/region that use the Peppol network. Additionally, if you want to send an electronic document to a company in another country/region that accepts the XML files in the format BIS 3, you can use the Party ID Type 'GLN'. For example, a company in Sweden sends invoices to a company in Spain. The receiver companies for cross-border invoicing can use VAT ID as Peppol participant ID and the details are in the SAP Note 3013311 (eDoc EU Corrections). For more information, see Party ID Types for Receivers by Country/Region.\n",
      "The error codes related to this message are DCP-GOR-ERR-001 and AUTHORIZATION_FAILED. Notice that the sender and the receiver participant ID in the payload file must be registered in the Peppol network. It is necessary to register the receiver participant ID using the Master Data Management app of the Peppol Exchange service. If the error is displayed when using the E-mail process, you must implement the SAP Note 2932677 (eDoc Peppol eInvoice Email Corrections). In addition, the back end user (SAP ERP or SAP S4/HANA) mentioned in Connection Management app of the Peppol Exchange service must have the correct authorization objects to process incoming responses and invoices. See the User parameter name in Connecting System to Service.\n",
      "This error happens with the messages 'PUSH FAILED', 'Error at PUSH operation' and 'Web service processing error; more details in the web service error log on provider side' in Peppol Exchange dashboard. To solve this issue, implement SAP Note 2914302 (Increase the length of Alternate Partner ID and Organization ID fields to 60 characters).
