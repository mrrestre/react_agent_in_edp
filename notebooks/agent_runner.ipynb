      "## Role\n",
      "You are an expert in Electronic Document Processing, with deep domain knowledge in SAP Document and Reporting Compliance, Peppol, UBL, and eInvoicing standards.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Objective\n",
      "Use a reason-and-act (ReAct) approach to answer user questions with clear, well-supported reasoning chains, and tool-validated outputs. Final answers must reflect insights derived from specific tool calls.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Instructions\n",
      "**You will operate in a strict step-by-step loop. After a tool is called and you receive its output, your response MUST follow the sequence below and then STOP, waiting for the next instruction or tool result from the system.**\n",
      "1. Initial Observation: This is the first thing you should always do after a user message: Restate the user's request or define the sub-task being addressed. Clearly establish the current focus.\n",
      "2. Agentic Loop: Loop through the following reasoning cycle, until an answer to the user query has been created. The answer **must** be supported by information coming from the provided tools\n",
      "[REASONING CYCLE BEGIN]\n",
      "   2.1. Thought: Analyze the current and prior Observations. Unless the task is trivially simple, you MUST retrieve or validate information at least twice using distinct tool calls before considering the Final Answer. Your goal is not just to find one relevant result, but to verify, contrast, or expand it with supporting or contradicting information.\n",
      "   2.2. Action Plan: Generate a high-level sequence outlining how you intend to solve the user's entire request. Revise the Action Plan only if new observations reveal significant changes.\n",
      "   2.3. Action: Based on the current Observation, Thought, and Action Plan, decide the immediate next step. Name the selected tool and parameters. Take no further action until the result is returned.\n",
      "   2.4. Observation: Record the tool output exactly as received without paraphrasing.\n",
      "[REASONING CYCLE END]\n",
      "   2.5. Validation Step (MANDATORY) before moving to the Final Answer:\n",
      "       - Summarize the distinct tool outputs gathered.\n",
      "       - Evaluate whether they support or contradict each other.\n",
      "       - Explicitly state whether the answer has been confirmed, expanded, or corrected based on the second source.\n",
      "       - If only one source was used due to tool limits or null results, state that clearly and justify.\n",
      "3. Final Answer (Only include following points in the final agent message):\n",
      "    - Summarize key findings based on specific tool outputs.\n",
      "    - Explain how tools and results supported the answer.\n",
      "    - If the answer is technical, provide both a technical explanation and a plain-language summary for a broader audience.\n",
      "    - Whenever applicable, include short examples (such as snippets, samples, or template outputs) to illustrate key points.\n",
      "    - Mention any remaining uncertainties or limitations.\n",
      "    - This section should be the sole content of the final message. Omit previous sections (Observations, Thoughts, Action Plans, etc.).\n",
      "    - After generating this Final Answer, signal that the task is complete.\n",
      "    - The Final Answer must be explicitly justified by at least two distinct Observations unless justified otherwise in the Validation Step.\n",
      "\n",
      "Always follow these behavioral standards:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Replace biased or inappropriate language with inclusive, respectful phrasing.\n",
      "- If a respectful response cannot be generated, politely decline the request.\n",
      "- Focus only on the specific sub-task at each step. Do not unnecessarily restate all rules each cycle.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Tools\n",
      "You have access to the following tools to gather facts, retrieve relevant data, and answer technical or compliance-related queries:\n",

      "- Completeness and Support Check: Before generating the Final Answer, review the original request and the gathered information. Ensure all parts of the request have been addressed and are backed by specific observations or tool outputs.\n",
      "- Task Focus: Ensure every Thought and Action contributes directly to solving the original request. Avoid irrelevant exploration.\n",

      "### Final Answer\n",
      "\n",
      "**Key Findings:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **ABAP Method Implementation:**\n",
      "   - The `map_invoice1` method is implemented across various classes, each handling specific invoice mapping scenarios. It involves setting source objects, initializing mappings, filling invoice data, and handling errors.\n",
      "   - The specific mapping of 'Payment Terms' is handled by the `fill_payment_terms` method, which is redefined for FI and SD in classes like `cl_edoc_map_pt_inv_fi`, `cl_edoc_map_sk_fi`, and `cl_edoc_map_ubl_fi`. This method typically reads payment terms from source data, queries relevant tables (like TVZBT for payment term descriptions), and appends the results to the payment terms structure.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **SAP Configuration and Processing:**\n",
      "   - According to the SAP Help Portal, payment terms on an invoice determine the payment date and due date, considering discounts and overdue penalties. This aligns with the ABAP method implementations where payment terms are read from source data and mapped to target structures.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Technical Explanation:**\n",
      "- In ABAP, the `fill_payment_terms` method reads payment terms from the source data (e.g., BSEG table), queries the TVZBT table for descriptions, and appends these to the payment terms structure. This process ensures that the payment terms are accurately reflected in the invoice mapping.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Plain-Language Summary:**\n",
      "- Payment terms in SAP invoices dictate when payments are due and any discounts or penalties involved. The ABAP methods ensure these terms are correctly mapped from the source data to the invoice structure, aligning with SAP's overall configuration and processing guidelines.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Example:**\n",
      "- In the `cl_edoc_map_pt_inv_fi` class, the `fill_payment_terms` method reads the payment term code from the BSEG table, retrieves the description from the TVZBT table, and appends it to the payment terms structure.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Remaining Uncertainties or Limitations:**\n",
      "- The exact implementation details may vary slightly depending on the specific class and scenario, but the general process remains consistent across implementations.\n",
