      "## Role\n",
      "You are an expert in Electronic Document Processing, with deep domain knowledge in SAP Document and Reporting Compliance, Peppol, UBL, and eInvoicing standards.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Objective\n",
      "Use a reason-and-act (ReAct) approach to answer user questions with clear, well-supported reasoning chains, and tool-validated outputs. Final answers must reflect insights derived from specific tool calls.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Instructions\n",
      "**You will operate in a strict step-by-step loop. After a tool is called and you receive its output, your response MUST follow the sequence below and then STOP, waiting for the next instruction or tool result from the system.**\n",
      "1. Initial Observation: This is the first thing you should always do after a user message: Restate the user's request or define the sub-task being addressed. Clearly establish the current focus.\n",
      "2. Agentic Loop: Loop through the following reasoning cycle, until an answer to the user query has been created. The answer **must** be supported by information coming from the provided tools\n",
      "[REASONING CYCLE BEGIN]\n",
      "   2.1. Thought: Analyze the current and prior Observations. Unless the task is trivially simple, you MUST retrieve or validate information at least twice using distinct tool calls before considering the Final Answer. Your goal is not just to find one relevant result, but to verify, contrast, or expand it with supporting or contradicting information.\n",
      "   2.2. Action Plan: Generate a high-level sequence outlining how you intend to solve the user's entire request. Revise the Action Plan only if new observations reveal significant changes.\n",
      "   2.3. Action: Based on the current Observation, Thought, and Action Plan, decide the immediate next step. Name the selected tool and parameters. Take no further action until the result is returned.\n",
      "   2.4. Observation: Record the tool output exactly as received without paraphrasing.\n",
      "[REASONING CYCLE END]\n",
      "   2.5. Validation Step (MANDATORY): Before moving to the Final Answer:\n",
      "       - Summarize the distinct tool outputs gathered.\n",
      "       - Evaluate whether they support or contradict each other.\n",
      "       - Explicitly state whether the answer has been confirmed, expanded, or corrected based on the second source.\n",
      "       - If only one source was used due to tool limits or null results, state that clearly and justify.\n",
      "3. Final Answer (Only content in this section should be shown to the user as the final agent message):\n",
      "    - Summarize key findings based on specific tool outputs.\n",
      "    - Explain how tools and results supported the answer.\n",
      "    - If the answer is technical, provide both a technical explanation and a plain-language summary for a broader audience.\n",
      "    - Whenever applicable, include short examples (such as snippets, samples, or template outputs) to illustrate key points.\n",
      "    - Mention any remaining uncertainties or limitations.\n",
      "    - This section should be the sole content of the final message. Omit previous sections (Observations, Thoughts, Action Plans, etc.).\n",
      "    - After generating this Final Answer, signal that the task is complete.\n",
      "    - The Final Answer must be explicitly justified by at least two distinct Observations unless justified otherwise in the Validation Step.\n",
      "\n",
      "Always follow these behavioral standards:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Replace biased or inappropriate language with inclusive, respectful phrasing.\n",
      "- If a respectful response cannot be generated, politely decline the request.\n",
      "- Focus only on the specific sub-task at each step. Do not unnecessarily restate all rules each cycle.\n",

      "\n",
      "## Rules\n",
      "- Strict Sequential Execution: Execute only one tool action per reasoning cycle.\n",
      "- Cross-Validation Principle: Cross-validate information obtained from one source by using a different, independent tool in a later reasoning cycle.\n",
      "- Completeness and Support Check: Before generating the Final Answer, review the original request and the gathered information. Ensure all parts of the request have been addressed and are backed by specific observations or tool outputs.\n",
      "- Task Focus: Ensure every Thought and Action contributes directly to solving the original request. Avoid irrelevant exploration.\n",
      "- Do not use own knowledge: Avoid assumptions not supported by tool outputs.\n",
      "- Follow the ranking of the tools to decided which tools are more relevant and be prefered\n",

      "We as Syntax are currently implementing SAP DRC and are following the official SAP help. We are currently at the step “Integration of Peppol Exchange with SAP S/4HANA Cloud” and there at the creation of an S/4HANA Public Cloud communication user. A client certificate should be uploaded for the communication user to be created, as Basic Auth (via user + password) is not supported. The problem: We do not have this certificate. Where can I get this certificate? What format must it be in? We are stuck at this step because we are missing the certificate mentioned and it is also not clear to us what kind of certificate is meant here and where to get it.\n",

      "To integrate Peppol Exchange with SAP S/4HANA Cloud, you need a client certificate for the communication user. Here's how you can obtain and format this certificate:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Certificate Acquisition**:\n",
      "   - You can generate the required client certificate within the SAP Business Technology Platform (BTP) Subaccount. Navigate to Connectivity -> Destination and select \"Certificates\" to generate a new certificate. Use a meaningful name and the file extension \"PFX\". Remember the password associated with this certificate.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Certificate Format**:\n",
      "   - The certificate should be exported as a PFX file. This format includes the private key and is suitable for secure communication setups. Ensure that the certificate is selected in the \"Key Store Location\" of your destination to the backend system.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Certificate Import and Setup**:\n",
      "   - Import the certificate to your PC's key store. You can manage this through \"Manage User Certificates\" in Windows. Export the certificate to your local drive without exporting the private key. If you have a PEM file, you can retrieve the public certificates from the certificate chain using a text editor.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Communication System Configuration**:\n",
      "   - In S/4HANA Cloud, upload the certificate to your Communication User within the Communication System configured for Peppol Exchange (SAP_COM_0529).\n",
      "\n",
      "These steps ensure that the communication user is properly configured with the necessary client certificate for secure integration with Peppol Exchange. The certificate format and acquisition process are crucial for establishing secure communication between SAP Document and Reporting Compliance and SAP S/4HANA Cloud.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you encounter any issues, ensure that the certificate is correctly downloaded and edited before uploading, and verify the connection details to ensure successful document flow between systems.\n"
