         "To attach additional files (such as PDFs, CSVs, or supporting documents) to standard XML documents in SAP S/4HANA Public Cloud (for example, in e-invoicing scenarios), you must use the BAdI EDOC_ADAPTOR_CLOUD. This extensibility point allows you to enhance the generated XML by embedding attachments as Base64-encoded content within the XML structure, specifically in the ADDITIONAL_DOCUMENT_REFERENCE node, which is compliant with standards like Peppol and UBL.\n\n**Technical Steps:**\n1. In Eclipse/ADT, implement the BAdI EDOC_ADAPTOR_CLOUD (Enhancement Spot ES_EDOCUMENT_CLOUD).\n2. In the relevant method (e.g., SET_OUTPUT_DATA or fill_xml_file), copy the input XML to the output structure.\n3. For each attachment:\n   - Convert the file to Base64.\n   - Populate the required fields (ID, document type code, description, MIME type, filename, Base64 content).\n   - Append each attachment as a new line in the ADDITIONAL_DOCUMENT_REFERENCE node.\n4. Activate your implementation.\n5. Test by generating an eDocument and reviewing the XML in the Manage Electronic Documents Fiori app or eDocument Cockpit.\n\n**Example ABAP Snippet:**\n```abap\nDATA: ls_add_doc_ref_line LIKE LINE OF xml_file_modified-additional_document_reference.\n\nxml_file_modified = xml_file.\n\nCONCATENATE xml_file_modified-id-base-base-content '-att1' INTO ls_add_doc_ref_line-id-base-base-content.\nls_add_doc_ref_line-document_type_code-base-base-content = '150'.\nls_add_doc_ref_line-document_description-base-base-content = 'Supporting PDF'.\nls_add_doc_ref_line-attachment-embedded_document_binary_objec-base-mime_code = 'application/pdf'.\nls_add_doc_ref_line-attachment-embedded_document_binary_objec-base-filename = 'invoice.pdf'.\nls_add_doc_ref_line-attachment-embedded_document_binary_objec-base-content = '<Base64 PDF content>'.\n\nAPPEND ls_add_doc_ref_line TO xml_file_modified-additional_document_reference.\n```\n\n**Plain-language summary:**  \nYou can add extra files to your XML documents in SAP Public Cloud by having a developer implement a small ABAP enhancement. This enhancement reads your attachments, converts them to a special text format (Base64), and inserts them into the XML file before it is sent out. This is fully supported for e-invoicing and similar processes.\n\n**Limitations:**  \n- Requires developer access and ABAP skills.\n- Only possible via released BAdIs; not a simple configuration.\n- The approach must comply with the XML schema of your target standard (e.g., Peppol, UBL).",

         "The generated answer is partially helpful in addressing the question about extending the existing eDocument customer invoice process for Public Cloud customers in Italy. Here's the reasoning:\n\n1. Accuracy:\n   - The answer correctly states that it is possible to extend the eDocument process in SAP S/4HANA Public Cloud for Italy.\n   - It mentions the use of BAdI EDOC_ADAPTOR_CLOUD for extensibility, which is a specific and relevant piece of information.\n   - The answer provides examples of possible extensions, such as enhancing XML mapping and controlling when eDocuments are created.\n\n2. Completeness:\n   - The generated answer goes beyond the expert answer by providing more detailed information about extension methods (developer and key user extensibility) and specific examples.\n   - It mentions limitations and prerequisites, which are not present in the expert answer but are relevant to the question.\n\n3. Alignment with tool-provided context:\n   - The generated answer focuses more on the technical aspects of extensibility, while the tool-provided context emphasizes the process flow and status management of eDocuments.\n   - The answer doesn't mention the eDocument Cockpit app or the Process eDocument Inbound Messages app, which are crucial parts of the eDocument process according to the context.\n   - The handling of foreign electronic invoices, which is detailed in the context, is not addressed in the generated answer.\n\n4. Omissions and potential inaccuracies:\n   - The answer doesn't discuss the specific process steps for managing eDocuments in Italy, such as posting, submission, and status updates, which are outlined in the tool-provided context.\n   - While the technical extensibility information provided may be accurate, it's not directly supported by the tool-provided context, which focuses more on process flow rather than technical implementation details.\n\nIn conclusion, the generated answer is partially helpful because it provides relevant information about the possibility of extending the eDocument process and some methods to do so. However, it lacks important details about the actual process flow and management of eDocuments in Italy, which are crucial for understanding the context in which these extensions would be applied. The answer would be more complete if it combined the technical extensibility information with the process-oriented details provided in the tool context.",

         "As a Public Cloud customer in Italy, you can extend the existing eDocument customer invoice process in SAP S/4HANA Public Cloud. SAP provides extensibility options through the BAdI EDOC_ADAPTOR_CLOUD, which allows you to:\n\n- Enhance or modify the standard XML mapping for Italian eInvoices (FatturaPA), such as adding custom fields or adjusting the XML structure to meet business or legal requirements.\n- Implement custom logic to control when eDocuments are created (e.g., skip zero-value invoices) or to define custom cancellation logic.\n- Add attachments to the XML file if required by Italian regulations.\n\nThere are two main approaches:\n1. Developer extensibility: Use ABAP Development Tools (ADT/Eclipse) to implement the BAdI for complex logic and XML mapping changes.\n2. Key user extensibility: Use the Custom Logic app in SAP Fiori for simpler enhancements, such as adding or removing XML fields or attachments.\n\nExample:\nIf you need to include a customer material number in the FatturaPA XML, you can implement the relevant method in the BAdI EDOC_ADAPTOR_CLOUD to add this field during XML generation.\n\nLimitations:\n- All extensibility must use the released BAdIs and extension points; direct modification of SAP standard code is not possible in Public Cloud.\n- Some prerequisites, such as registering with Italian tax authorities and setting up digital signatures, are required for legal compliance but are not part of the extensibility process itself.\n\nIn summary, SAP S/4HANA Public Cloud for Italy supports extensibility of the eDocument customer invoice process through officially released BAdIs, with both developer and key user options available. This ensures you can meet local legal requirements and specific business needs while remaining within SAP Public Cloud extensibility guidelines.",

This includes adding new actions (like custom submission or status checks) and fields, as long as you use the provided cloud extensibility tools. You cannot use classic SAP development tools, but you can achieve most customizations through the cloud’s configuration and developer extensibility options.\n\nExample:\n- To add a custom “Resubmit” action, you would:\n  1.

         "Key Findings:\n- Both the eDocument Cockpit and the Manage Electronic Documents app in SAP support restricting the visibility of eDocuments using custom fields, such as organizational unit.\n- The process involves extending the relevant app with custom fields (using the Custom Fields and Custom Logic app), populating those fields from source documents (like billing or accounting documents), and then leveraging SAP Identity and Access Management (IAM) restriction types to control access.\n- For the Manage Electronic Documents app, SAP provides a specific IAM restriction type: ElectronicDocument:Restriction for Organizational Unit (EDO_ORG). This allows you to restrict document visibility so that users only see documents relevant to their assigned organizational unit.\n- The restriction is enforced at the IAM (authorization) level, and configuration is done via business roles and catalogs in SAP Fiori.\n\nHow the Tools and Results Supported the Answer:\n- The SAP documentation summary confirmed the general approach for the eDocument Cockpit: extend with custom fields, define organizational units, and implement authorization checks.\n- The SAP Help lookup provided detailed, stepwise technical guidance for the Manage Electronic Documents app, including the use of the EDO_ORG restriction type and the necessary configuration steps.\n\nTechnical Explanation:\n- Add a custom field (e.g., organizational unit) to the eDocument object using the Custom Fields and Custom Logic app.\n- Populate this field from the source document during eDocument creation.\n- Assign the IAM restriction type EDO_ORG to relevant business roles, ensuring users only see documents for their organizational unit.\n- This setup is managed via SAP Fiori apps for business role and catalog management.\n\nPlain-Language Summary:\nYes, you can restrict who sees which eDocuments in both the Manage Electronic Documents and eDocument Cockpit apps by adding custom fields (like organizational unit) and configuring SAP’s authorization system to only show documents to users with the right permissions for those fields.\n\nExample:\n- You add a custom field “Org Unit” to eDocuments.\n- When a document is created, the Org Unit from the billing document is copied into this field.\n- You configure SAP roles so that users in Org Unit A only see documents where “Org Unit” = A.\n\nLimitations/Uncertainties:\n- Custom fields added are available for all processes in the Manage Electronic Documents app; process-specific restriction is not currently supported.\n- Availability of features may depend on country/region and activated scope items.\n- After SAP upgrades, review business role and IAM object changes to ensure restrictions remain effective.",

For such advanced requirements, you may need to explore additional BAdIs, SAP Notes, or consider side-by-side extensions (e.g., custom Fiori apps or APIs).\n\nTechnical Explanation:\n- Use the Custom Logic app to implement BAdIs for custom fields and logic.\n- Example: Implement EDOC_CUSTOM_FIELDS_CLOUD to add a custom field, and populate it from source documents.\n- For advanced process or action extension, check for available BAdIs or consider developing a side-by-side extension.\n\nPlain-Language Summary:\n- Yes, you can extend the eDocument Cockpit for your own custom processes in SAP Private Cloud, mainly by adding custom fields and logic using SAP’s enhancement framework (BAdIs).\n- If you want to add entirely new actions or process steps in the cockpit, this may require more advanced development or integration with custom apps.\n\nExample:\n- To add a custom field to the cockpit:\n  1. Open the Custom Logic app.\n  2. Select the Document Compliance business context.\n  3. Implement the EDOC_CUSTOM_FIELDS_CLOUD BAdI to add and populate your field.\n  4.

         "Yes, as a Public Cloud customer in Germany, you can restrict the creation of eDocuments in the \"Manage Electronic Document\" and \"eDocument Cockpit\" apps if certain conditions are met. This is achieved primarily through the implementation of the BAdI (Business Add-In) EDOC_ADAPTOR_CLOUD, which is available for developer extensibility in SAP S/4HANA Public Cloud.\n\nTechnical Explanation:\n- You implement the BAdI EDOC_ADAPTOR_CLOUD in the ABAP Development Tools (ADT) environment.\n- In your implementation, you write logic to determine whether an eDocument should be created for a given source document (e.g., based on document type, invoice value, or custom business rules).\n- If your logic determines that the document should not trigger an eDocument, you set the relevant parameter (such as cv_relevant) to \"false,\" preventing eDocument creation.\n- You can further refine this by using BAdI filters for country or other criteria.\n- Additionally, you can use configuration settings to map eDocument types only to the document types you want, and activate eDocument creation only for relevant company codes and source types.\n\nPlain-Language Summary:\nYou can set up SAP S/4HANA Public Cloud so that eDocuments are only created when your specific business conditions are met. This is done by having a developer implement a small piece of custom logic (using a standard SAP extension point) that checks each document and decides whether or not to create an eDocument. You can also use standard configuration to limit which types of documents are eligible for eDocument creation.\n\nExample:\nIf you want to prevent eDocument creation for zero-value invoices, your BAdI implementation would check the invoice amount and skip eDocument creation if the amount is zero.\n\nLimitations:\n- This extensibility requires developer access (not key user extensibility).\n- The BAdI must be implemented in the Eclipse-based ABAP Development Tools.\n- Configuration options provide additional, but less granular, control.",

Next, you define the steps and statuses your electronic document process will follow. You configure these in SAP’s apps, then write custom code (using SAP’s extension points) if you need special logic or integration. You can also add custom fields or adapt the user interface. For country-specific needs, you extend the process further. Finally, you test everything before going live.\n\n**Limitations/Uncertainties:**\n- Some steps may require additional configuration or adaptation based on specific country/legal requirements.\n- Deep technical development (e.g., ABAP class implementation) requires developer access and familiarity with SAP extensibility.",

This is the central entry point for DRC process configuration and extensibility.\n\n3. **Extending Payment Medium Formats (Italy Example)**\n   - Open the \"Map Format Data for Payments\" app from the configuration environment.\n   - Select or create the relevant Italian payment format (e.g., IT_CBI_XML_CT_00_04_01, IT_CBI_XML_DD_00_01_01).\n   - Use the app to display, import, export, edit, check, and release payment medium formats.\n\n4. **Implement Extensibility (Custom Fields/Logic)**\n   - Use Business Add-Ins (BAdIs) for extensibility:\n     - **Custom Reference Fields:** Implement the BAdI for \"Payment Medium: Custom Additional Reference Fields\" to add custom fields (e.g., CUP, CIG) to payment formats.\n     - **Custom File Naming:** Implement the BAdI for \"Payment Medium: Change File Name\" to define custom naming rules for payment files.\n   - For advanced requirements, use developer extensibility to extend incoming or outgoing format mappings.\n\n5. **Edit and Release the Format**\n   - After making changes, use the app to check and release the updated format for productive use.\n\n6. **Test the Process**\n   - Generate a payment file or electronic document and verify that your custom fields or logic are correctly applied.\n\n7. **Additional Extensibility for DRC**\n   - The \"Manage Electronic Documents\" app also allows you to create custom electronic document processes (e.g., for eInvoicing or VAT reporting) using in-app extensibility tools to add fields, logic, or new process variants.\n\n**Example: Adding Custom Fields to Italian Payment Formats**\n- Open \"Map Format Data for Payments\" app.\n- Select the relevant Italian payment format.\n- Implement the BAdI for custom reference fields in the Extensibility section.\n- Add your custom logic/fields (e.g., CUP, CIG).\n- Save, release, and test the format.\n\n**Technical Explanation:**  \nAll configuration is performed via Fiori apps in S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition. Extensibility is achieved through BAdIs and developer tools, with custom fields using the Z namespace. No classic SAP GUI transactions are used.\n\n**Plain-Language Summary:**  \nYou use SAP’s cloud-based apps to set up and extend electronic document processes for Italy. You can add custom fields or logic (like special codes required by Italian law) using built-in extension points, and all changes are managed in the cloud environment.\n\n**Limitations:**  \n- All steps must be performed in the SAP S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition environment.\n- Some extensibility features may require developer skills or coordination with SAP support for advanced scenarios.",

         "In SAP S/4HANA Public Cloud, you cannot create custom database tables in the traditional sense (as in on-premise or private cloud) for Document and Reporting Compliance (DRC) extensibility use cases. The system restricts direct table creation via classic SAP GUI tools (like SE11/SE16N), and custom tables for transactional processing are not supported through Key User Extensibility.\n\nHowever, you have the following options:\n\n1. **Custom Business Objects App:**  \n   - You can use the \"Custom Business Objects\" Fiori app to create custom business objects, which provide a way to store and manage custom data. These objects can be exposed via APIs and used in statutory reporting or DRC scenarios.\n   - Example: You create a custom business object called \"ZCOUNTRY_TAX_DATA\" to store country-specific tax information, and expose it via OData for use in DRC processes.\n\n2. **Developer Extensibility (if available):**  \n   - In a 3-system landscape (DEV/QAS/PRD), you can use Developer Extensibility with ABAP Development Tools (ADT) to create custom database tables, CDS views, and RAP-based services.\n   - These tables are not automatically integrated into DRC; you must explicitly build the integration using APIs, RAP, or BAdIs.\n   - Example: You define a custom table \"ZDRC_COUNTRY_PROC\" in ADT, create a CDS view to expose its data, and build a RAP service to interact with DRC processes.\n\n3. **Side-by-Side Extensibility (SAP BTP):**  \n   - For more advanced scenarios, you can build custom applications with their own tables on SAP BTP and integrate with S/4HANA Public Cloud via APIs or events.\n\n**Plain-language summary:**  \nYou cannot create your own database tables directly in S/4HANA Public Cloud for DRC. Instead, use the Custom Business Objects app for most extensibility needs, or Developer Extensibility (if your system supports it) for more advanced scenarios. All integration with DRC must be done via released APIs and extension points.\n\n**Limitations:**  \n- No classic table creation or direct transactional table access.\n- Developer Extensibility is only available in certain system landscapes.\n- Custom tables are not automatically part of DRC; explicit integration is required.\n\n**Task complete.**",

         "Key Findings:\n- In SAP Document and Reporting Compliance (DRC), the eDocument Type is a foundational configuration object. It defines which business documents (such as invoices, credit notes, or delivery notes) are processed as eDocuments for compliance with local regulations.\n- Creating an eDocument Type is necessary because it:\n  - Maps business document types to compliance scenarios, ensuring the correct documents are processed electronically.\n  - Determines the structure, processing logic, and compliance requirements for each scenario.\n  - Enables extensibility, allowing you to adapt the process for country-specific or business-specific needs using Custom Logic (BAdIs) and Custom Fields.\n  - Supports cockpit extensibility, letting you add custom fields and enhanced authorization to the eDocument Cockpit for tailored management and visibility.\n\nTechnical Explanation:\n- The eDocument Type acts as the link between your business processes and the DRC framework. When you create a new process (for example, for a new country or document type), you must define an eDocument Type so that the system knows when and how to generate, validate, and transmit the required electronic documents.\n- Extensibility is achieved by:\n  - Implementing BAdIs (Business Add-Ins) via the Custom Logic app to add or change processing logic.\n  - Adding custom fields via the Custom Fields app to enrich eDocuments with additional data or to control authorization.\n  - Assigning factory classes to control the creation of eDocument instances for new or extended processes.\n\nPlain-Language Summary:\n- You need to create an eDocument Type because it tells SAP which documents should be handled electronically for compliance, and how to process them. It also gives you the flexibility to customize the process for your specific business or regulatory needs, all through user-friendly Fiori apps without classic ABAP development.\n\nExample:\n- If you want to process a new type of invoice for a specific country, you would:\n  1. Create a new eDocument Type for that scenario.\n  2. Map it to the relevant business document types.\n  3. Use Custom Logic to add any special processing rules.\n  4. Add custom fields if you need to store extra information or control who can see the documents.\n\nLimitations:\n- All extensions and customizations must be done within the supported Fiori apps and BAdIs; classic ABAP development is not available in Public Cloud.",

         "Key Findings (based on SAP documentation summary):\n\nTo enable document exchange from an external system to SAP in a Private Cloud environment, you must complete the following settings:\n\n1. Certificate Generation and Authentication: Generate a certificate (typically in PFX format) for secure communication. This is configured in SAP BTP under Connectivity → Destination, and the certificate is used for authentication between systems.\n\n2. RFC Activation: Activate a Remote Function Call (RFC) connection in your SAP system (using transaction GCO_RFC_CONF) to enable communication between SAP Document and Reporting Compliance (DRC) and your SAP S/4HANA Private Cloud system. Only one RFC should be active at a time.\n\n3. Integration Steps: Complete specific integration steps based on the document type and process (e.g., Peppol Exchange). This includes configuring participants and communication parties as required by your scenario.\n\n4. User Authorizations: Ensure the user/service account used for document exchange has the necessary authorizations, such as EDO_BUK, EDO_PROC, S_PROGNAM (EDOC_MESSAGE_HANDLING), and the SAP_BC_WEBSERVICE_SERVICE_USER role.\n\n5. Logical Port Configuration: Update and review logical port settings (e.g., CO_EDO_UBL_SEND_APPL_RESP_V1_0) to ensure correct routing and processing of inbound documents.\n\nHow the tools supported the answer:\n- The SAP documentation summary provided a comprehensive, step-by-step list of required settings and referenced official SAP sources.\n- The SAP Help lookup did not return additional content, so the answer is based solely on the documentation summary.\n\nTechnical Explanation:\nThese settings establish secure, authenticated, and authorized communication channels between your external system and SAP Private Cloud. They ensure that documents are correctly routed, processed, and logged in SAP, and that only authorized users or systems can perform these operations.\n\nPlain-language summary:\nBefore you can send documents from an external system to SAP Private Cloud, you need to set up secure connections (with certificates), activate the right communication channels (RFC), assign the correct user permissions, and configure the system to recognize and process incoming documents.\n\nExample:\n- Generate a PFX certificate in SAP BTP and upload it to your destination configuration.\n- Use transaction GCO_RFC_CONF in SAP to activate the RFC connection.\n- Assign the SAP_BC_WEBSERVICE_SERVICE_USER role to your integration user.\n- Configure the logical port CO_EDO_UBL_SEND_APPL_RESP_V1_0 for document routing.\n\nLimitations:\n- The answer is based on the SAP documentation summary; SAP Help did not provide further details.\n- Specific integration steps may vary depending on the document type and business process.",

System and Communication Configuration:**\n- Activate Remote Function Call (RFC) connections between SAP DRC and your SAP S/4HANA system.\n- Set up communication arrangements for the relevant process (e.g., Peppol, e-Invoicing) to connect the business system, DRC cloud edition, and external parties.\n\n**3. SAP System Settings:**\n- Activate the required business functions in transaction SFW5 (ENTERPRISE_BUSINESS_FUNCTIONS) based on your licensing and country requirements.\n- Ensure correct authorization objects are assigned in both the backend system and any middleware (such as Peppol Exchange).\n- Enable eDocument creation in transaction FIBF by checking the 'EDOC' option.\n- Configure logical ports for client proxies (e.g., CO_EDO_UBL_SEND_CRED_NOTE_V1_0).\n\n**4. Credentials and Security:**\n- Maintain and validate credentials (usernames, passwords, certificates) in the SAP BTP or middleware security material, following best practices and country-specific requirements.\n- Update credentials as needed, especially after system refreshes or upgrades.\n\n**5. Manual Activities and SAP Notes:**\n- Execute required reports and manual steps from SAP Notes relevant to your process and country (e.g., 2949379 for Peppol, 2010697 for AIF Customizing, 1995867 for EDP Framework, 2783795 for Peppol Installation).\n- Always run these reports with 'Update and Activate' or 'Generate Maintenance Dialog' options and check for errors.\n\n**Example:**\n- To enable Peppol e-Invoicing, you would:\n  - Activate the relevant business function in SFW5.\n  - Set up the RFC and communication arrangement for Peppol.\n  - Assign the correct authorization objects.\n  - Follow SAP Note 2949379 for Peppol configuration.\n\n**Plain-Language Summary:**\nBefore you can send documents from an external system to SAP in Private Cloud, you need to set up secure connections, activate the right features in SAP, make sure users have the right permissions, and follow SAP’s step-by-step guides (SAP Notes) for your specific process or country. This ensures documents can flow smoothly and securely between systems.\n\n**Limitations/Uncertainties:**\n- Some steps may vary depending on the specific process (e.g., e-Invoicing, Peppol) and country requirements.\n- Always consult the latest SAP Notes and official documentation for your scenario.",

Specificity: The generated answer provides specific version numbers and configuration details, which are helpful. However, some of these details (e.g., the mention of version 2308 for Manage Electronic Documents app extensibility) are not explicitly confirmed by our tool outputs and may require further verification.\n\n5. Omissions: The generated answer doesn't mention some important points from the expert answer, such as considering document bundling or defining message formats and versioning.\n\n6. Additional Information: The generated answer includes helpful information not mentioned in the expert answer, such as the need for a 3-system landscape and the use of ABAP Development Tools (ADT) in Eclipse.\n\nIn conclusion, while the generated answer is more comprehensive than the expert answer and provides valuable technical details, it partially misses the process-specific considerations that the expert answer emphasizes. It also includes some specific details that weren't directly confirmed by our authoritative sources. Therefore, it is considered partially helpful, as it provides a good starting point but may need some refinement and additional process-specific considerations to fully address the question.",

         "Yes, in SAP S/4HANA Private Cloud using Document and Reporting Compliance (DRC), you can control the visibility of electronic documents with custom fields by leveraging DRC extensibility and SAP’s authorization framework.\n\nTechnical Explanation:\n- You can add custom fields to electronic documents in the eDocument Cockpit using extensibility options such as BAdIs (e.g., FILL_EDOC_CUSTOM_FIELDS of BAdI EDOC_CUSTOM_FIELDS_CLOUD).\n- To control visibility, you must:\n  1. Configure the custom field in the relevant DRC configuration activities (e.g., for custom ODN types).\n  2. Map the custom field for visibility in Fiori apps or SAP GUI.\n  3. Use SAP authorization objects and restriction types (such as Sensitivity) to restrict access to documents or fields based on user roles or organizational units.\n  4. Assign the necessary business roles and catalogs to users to enforce these restrictions.\n\nPlain-Language Summary:\n- You can add your own fields to electronic documents in DRC.\n- You can then set up rules so that only certain users or roles can see documents (or specific fields) based on these custom fields, such as restricting by company code, department, or other criteria.\n- This is done by configuring both the fields and the access controls in SAP.\n\nExample:\n- Suppose you add a custom field “Region” to your e-invoices.\n- You can configure SAP so that only users assigned to the “North Region” business role can see documents where Region = “North”.\n- This is achieved by mapping the field and setting up the appropriate authorization objects and restriction types.\n\nLimitations:\n- The exact steps require configuration in both the DRC extensibility framework and SAP’s Identity and Access Management.\n- Some features may require technical implementation (e.g., BAdI coding) and careful mapping of custom fields to authorization logic.",
