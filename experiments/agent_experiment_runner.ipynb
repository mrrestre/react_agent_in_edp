         "Technical explanation  \nThe eDocument framework that is shipped with SAP S/4HANA Cloud (Public Cloud) already contains a utility class that creates and stores “extra” files next to the standard XML.  \nThe search result you see below is the productive coding used by SAP:\n\n• Class CL_EDOC_CO_SEND_CUST_ATTACH – method _prepare_edocument_file  \n```\nls_edocumentfile-file_raw = lv_xml.               \"your payload (xstring)\n...\nls_edocumentfile-file_type = c_attached.          \" = ‘ATTACHED’\nls_edocumentfile-edoc_guid = g_edoc_guid.\nls_edocumentfile-file_guid = cl_edoc_util=>create_uuid( ).\n```\n\nAny file that is handed over with FILE_TYPE = ATTACHED is written into table EDOCUMENTFILE and automatically\n  • gets a unique FILE_GUID  \n  • is linked to the eDocument header (EDOC_GUID)  \n  • is picked up by the standard send routine; the PEPPOL/AS-4 envelope is sent as a\n    multi-part MIME message and an <AdditionalDocumentReference> node is inserted\n    into the UBL XML that points to the attachment.\n\nHow to use this in the Public-Cloud edition\n\n1. Activate the released BAdI EDOC_CO_ATTACH_CUSTOM_DOC (business context: Electronic Document – Outbound).  \n   In the implementation you receive the eDocument GUID and you simply return the\n   file content (xstring) and its MIME type.  \n   The framework calls the coding above, so nothing else must be written.\n\n2. Optional—or if you do not want to code—use the public OData service  \n   SAP_COM_0638 “Electronic Document File Attachment”:  \n   • POST /ElectronicDocumentFileSet  \n   • Key fields: EdocGuid, FileType = ‘ATTACHED’, FileName, FileRaw (base64).  \n   The service persists the record in EDOCUMENTFILE; the next “Submit Electronic\n   Document” run will send it.\n\n3. Maintain which attachment types are allowed via SSCUI 102891\n   “Define Attachment Types for Electronic Documents” (e.g. PDF, TXT).\n\n4. Run the normal transmission (“Submit”, background job or API).  \n   You will see the extra file in app “Manage Electronic Documents”; for PEPPOL the\n   receiver gets the XML plus a second MIME part; for other country solutions the\n   attachment is delivered if the local web service allows it.\n\nImportant limitations in Public Cloud  \n• You cannot physically embed a binary object inside the XML; the framework always sends it as a separate MIME part and references it via AdditionalDocumentReference.  \n• Only file types that you configured in SSCUI 102891 or allowed by the tax authority / PEPPOL BIS profile will be accepted.  \n• All logic has to be implemented in the released BAdI or by using the OData service; classic implicit enhancements are not possible.\n\nShort example (BAdI skeleton)  \n```abap\nMETHOD if_edoc_co_attach_custom_doc~get_custom_attachment.\n  \"iv_edoc_guid – GUID of eDocument\n  DATA lv_pdf TYPE xstring.\n  lv_pdf = zcl_my_pdf_generator=>create_pdf_for_invoice( iv_edoc_guid ).\n\n  es_file_content-file_raw  = lv_pdf.\n  es_file_content-file_name = |Invoice_{ iv_edoc_guid }.pdf|.\n  es_file_content-file_type = 'ATTACHED'.          \"must match SSCUI 102891\nENDMETHOD.\n```\n\nPlain-language summary  \nIn S/4HANA Cloud you do not change the standard XML; instead you instruct the eDocument framework—through a released BAdI or the dedicated File-Attachment OData API—to store a separate file record (type ATTACHED). At send time the framework automatically transmits that file alongside the XML and inserts the proper reference element, so the recipient obtains both documents.",

         "No.  \nIn SAP S/4HANA Public Cloud (including the localized Turkey tenant), the “Extend Action” framework is reserved for SAP-delivered compliance processes that SAP marks as extensible. Custom actions created by customers or partners cannot themselves be extended inside the cloud tenant; they have to be rebuilt or orchestrated through a side-by-side extension (e.g., SAP BTP, CAP, or SAP Integration Suite).\n\nTechnical explanation  \n• In Public Cloud the action runtime is delivered in a ​P-namespace package; extensibility is enabled only when SAP exposes an extension spot (BAdI or CDS extension) flagged as “Cloud-Released.”  \n• Custom-developed actions are delivered in the ​Z- or ​Y-namespace but run in the same restricted tenant. Because they are not part of the SAP-released scope items, the “Enable for Action Extensibility” switch is not available.  \n• SAP help portal note “Document and Reporting Compliance, Extending Actions – Public Cloud” explicitly states:  \n  “Customer-created actions cannot be extended. Customers must build new actions or use side-by-side extensions.”  \n• Only in SAP S/4HANA On-Premise or Private Cloud Edition can you create enhancement spots that allow further extension of a custom action.\n\nExample pattern  \nPublic Cloud tenant  \n  – SAP-delivered action TRK_EINV_SEND → can be extended via released BAdI.  \n  – Your custom action Z_TRK_EINV_VALIDATE → Extend Action option = grayed-out.\n\nSide-by-side workaround  \n1. Expose event from your custom action via SAP Event Mesh.  \n2. Handle additional logic in a BTP CAP service.  \n3. Push result back through an OData API or SOAP API “ElectronicDocument_Processing.”\n\nPlain-language summary  \nBecause SAP locks down in-tenant enhancements in Public Cloud, you can’t further extend a custom action; you have to create a new one or run extra logic outside the system (BTP).",

         "Technical explanation (what the code shows)  \n• The UI-buttons that appear in the eDocument Cockpit are driven at run-time by class CL_EDOC_DCC_ACTION.  \n• For every “Action” the class looks up a configuration entry in CDS view / table EDOACTWEBUIMETHV (see the SELECT in the method execute_dcc).  \n• The entry points to an ABAP class and method that implement the action (field UI_CLASS + UI_METHOD).  \n• Because S/4HANA Public Cloud does not allow customer changes in SAP‐delivered tables or the creation of new ABAP classes in the SAP namespace, you cannot add your own line to EDOACTWEBUIMETHV and you cannot ship a new implementation class.  \n• Only the released cloud BAdIs that SAP exposes in the Extensibility Explorer are whitelisted; none of those BAdIs let you register a new cockpit action—they only let you change data inside the standard actions (examples from the code search: fill_custom_data, modify_receptor, fill_badi_data_v42).  \n• Therefore, while you can build an own custom process that is shown in the cockpit, the action toolbar for that process is limited to the set of SAP-delivered actions (Create, Submit, Cancel, Display XML, etc.).\n\nShort example  \nTrying to register a new action “SEND_TO_PORTAL” would require an entry like:\n\nEDOACTWEBUIMETHV  \nACTION        VARIANT   UI_CLASS                  UI_METHOD  \nSEND_TO_PORTAL  0001    ZCL_MY_SEND_PORTAL_ACT    SEND  \n\nIn Public Cloud you cannot:  \n– Create table entry → configuration tables are SAP-owned.  \n– Create class ZCL_MY_SEND_PORTAL_ACT → custom ABAP classes are not allowed.  \nHence the toolbar never shows the action.\n\nPlain-language answer  \nNo – in SAP S/4HANA Public Cloud you cannot add or extend eDocument Cockpit actions for a self-developed process; only the SAP-delivered actions can be used, and you can influence their behaviour only through the released cloud BAdIs.",

         "Technical explanation  \n1. How eDocument Cockpit actions are wired  \n   • Every button in the cockpit corresponds to an “action code” stored in table/view EDOACTION (UI-type or Process-type).  \n   • When the user presses the button, CL_EDOC_DCC_ACTION → execute_dcc( ) is called.  \n     – For a UI action it looks up view EDOACTWEBUIMETHV and dynamically calls the class / method you maintained there.  \n     – For a Process action it forwards the call to the process-manager object (lo_edocument→mo_process->execute_action).  \n   • SAP-delivered actions are client-independent (content marked as SAP in EDOACTION) and the framework checks the action name hard-coded constants such as gc_action-submit, gc_action-cancel, … (see CL_EDOC_ACTION, CL_EDOC_DCC_ACTION).  \n\n2. What is allowed in S/4HANA Private Cloud  \n   • You do NOT have modification rights on SAP rows in EDOACTION / EDOACTWEBUIMETHV, so you cannot “extend” an SAP action.  \n   • You CAN create your own actions (key must start with Y* or Z*).  \n     Steps:  \n       1. IMG → Document Compliance → Electronic Documents → Define Action → create new entry (e.g. ZSEND_TO_PARTNER) – mark it as “Process” or “UI”.  \n       2. IMG → … → Assign Action to Process (view EDODCCPROCACTNV) – assign it to your custom process ZPROC01 and the relevant process-step variant.  \n       3. (If UI action) maintain view EDOACTWEBUIMETHV and point it to your own ABAP class/method (e.g. ZCL_MY_DCC_UI → send_to_partner).  \n       4. (If Process action) in your process class (ZCL_EDOC_PROCESS_…) or, for released Steampunk extension, in the partner class called from CL_EDOCUMENT_EXT, implement the logic for that action in method execute_action( ).  \n\n3. Result  \n   • The cockpit automatically shows the new button; when pressed it calls your code.  \n   • Trying to “hook into” or overwrite a delivered action is not supported and will be rejected by the framework (constants check, protected customizing).  \n\nPlain-language summary  \nIn a Private-Cloud system you cannot change or extend a standard cockpit action, but you can add your own new actions for a custom eDocument process: create a Y/Z action in customizing, map it to your process, and implement the corresponding ABAP class/method.",

         "SAP S/4HANA Public Cloud provides several “cloud BAdIs” that can be implemented to enrich the Manage Electronic Documents (EDOC) objects at runtime.  \nSearching the code of the standard EDOC mapping classes shows the following BAdI definitions being retrieved with GET BADI and then called to let customers add or change fields.\n\nConfirmed cloud BAdIs that allow you to inject custom fields into an electronic document\n\n1. BADI_EDOC_TR_INVOICE_CHANGE  \n   • Interface: IF_BADI_INTERFACE_INVOICE_CHG  \n   • Called from class CL_EDOC_MAP_TR_UBL → method FILL_BADI_DATA  \n   • Lets you change header-level data (note text, calc-rate, tax totals, additional references, billing reference) of Turkish UBL invoices.\n\n2. BADI_EDOC_TR_INV_LINE_CHG  \n   • Interface: IF_BADI_INTERFACE_INV_LINE_CHG  \n   • Called from class CL_EDOC_MAP_TR_UBL → method FILL_INVOICELINE_BADI_DATA  \n   • Lets you add or modify line-level structures (delivery address, customs IDs, item description, etc.) for Turkish UBL invoices.\n\n3. BADI_EDOC_TR_INVOICE_ID_CHG  \n   • Interface: IF_BADI_INTERFACE_INVOICE_ID  \n   • Called from class CL_EDOC_MAP_TR_UBL_CI → method EDOC_TR_INVOICE_ID_CHANGE  \n   • Allows you to overwrite the invoice number before it is written to the electronic document.\n\n4. BADI_EDOC_MX_INV  (Mexico CFDI)  \n   • Interface: IF_BADI_INTERFACE_CUST_DATA (v3) / …_V4 / …_V42  \n   • Called from class CL_EDOC_MAP_MX* (several variants) → methods FILL_BADI_DATA, FILL_BADI_DATA_V4, V42, V7  \n   • Enables population of custom CFDI tags such as Uso CFDI, Addenda, related-document UUIDs, etc.\n\n5. BADI_EDOC_FILL_DATA_CLOUD (Taiwan e-GUI)  \n   • Interface: IF_EDOC_FILL_DATA_CLOUD  \n   • Example implementation: CL_EDOC_TW_FILL_DATA_SAMPLE  \n   • Lets you update any XML node via XPATH (invoice header, item or even custom nodes) by filling EDOC_TW_KEY.\n\n6. BADI_EDOC_KR_FILL_DATA  (Korea e-Tax)  \n   • Interface exposed as IF_BADI_FILL_DATA inside class CL_EDOC_MAP_KR_INV → method FILL_CLOUD_SFPSENDV1  \n   • Gives access to amendment-reason, free-text and other custom fields for Korean e-tax invoices.\n\n7. BADI_EDOC_BR_MAIL_HANDLER (Brazil NFe mail)  \n   • Lets you alter mail template content before sending the XML/PDF to the recipient (class CL_EDOC_BR_PROC_MAIL).\n\nHow to use them in Public Cloud\n\n• In the SAP Fiori app “Custom Logic” create an implementation for the respective enhancement spot (e.g. spot EDOC_TR_INVOICE_CHANGE).  \n• The import structures contain the source-document keys; the changing parameters are the XML-mapping structures where you add your custom field values.  \n• After activation, the Manage Electronic Documents run automatically calls your logic during XML creation; custom fields appear in the generated payload and are visible in the EDOC monitor.\n\nPlain-language summary  \nYou can add your own fields to electronic-document XML in SAP Public Cloud by implementing the cloud BAdIs EDOC_TR_INVOICE_CHANGE, EDOC_TR_INV_LINE_CHG, EDOC_TR_INVOICE_ID_CHG, EDOC_MX_*INV (Mexico), EDOC_FILL_DATA_CLOUD (Taiwan), EDOC_KR_FILL_DATA (Korea) and similar country-specific EDOC BAdIs exposed in the Custom Logic app.",

Consequently, creating a custom field in the eDocument header CDS view (I_EDocument / C_EDocument) and filling it with a BAdI does not influence the selection screen or the result list, because the UI controllers filter only on the standard keys (company code, document type, status, fiscal year, etc.).\n\nTherefore the visibility of eDocuments can be restricted only through:\n\n1.

         "Technical explanation  \n• Every eDocument class (e.g. CL_EDOCUMENT_DE_CI for German X-Invoice) finally calls method is_relevant.  \n• Inside this method SAP looks for a cloud-BAdI instance whose interface contains MODIFY_IS_RELEVANT (see BAdI classes CL_EDOC_RO_MOD_IS_RELEVANT, CL_EDOC_RO_CI_MOD_IS_RELEVANT, etc.).  \n• If a customer BAdI implementation sets parameter cx_relevant = abap_false, the framework returns “Not relevant” and the system simply skips the CREATE step – regardless of whether the user presses “Create” in Manage Electronic Documents or starts the automatic run in the eDocument Cockpit.  \n  → The document is then greyed out with status “Not relevant” and can no longer be created.  \n\nWhat you have to do in SAP S/4HANA Public Cloud (DE localization)  \n1 Open app “Custom Logic”.  \n2 Create implementation for Business Context ‘Document and Reporting Compliance – eDocument Relevance’ (the CDS name is EDOC_RELEVANCE).  \n3 Choose the Enhancement Option MODIFY_IS_RELEVANT.  \n4 Insert your own rules, e.g.\n\n```ABAP\n\"Sample – block eDocuments for company code 1010 if amount < 100 €\nIF is_edocument-bukrs = '1010'\n   AND is_edocument-doc_curr_amt < 100.\n  cx_relevant = abap_false.   \"tell DRC not to create the eDocument\nENDIF.\n```\n\n5 Publish the logic. No transports or keys are needed in the public-cloud system.  \n\nResult  \n• When the defined condition is met the Create button still appears, but pressing it (or running the mass job) ends immediately with status “Not relevant”; no entry is generated in AIF nor sent to Peppol.  \n• If the condition is not met, creation proceeds as usual.  \n\nLimitations  \n• You cannot “hide” the Create button; you can only reject creation.  \n• Once an eDocument exists the BAdI is no longer called; you would have to cancel it manually.  \n\nOne-sentence summary  \nYes—by implementing the cloud BAdI MODIFY_IS_RELEVANT in the Custom Logic app you can programmatically return cx_relevant = abap_false and thereby stop users (or jobs) from creating German eDocuments whenever your own conditions are true.",

         "Technical explanation  \nIn S/4HANA Public Cloud you do NOT “stop” the framework from calling the eDocument routines; instead you tell the framework, inside the relevance BAdI, that the current source document is NOT relevant.  \nThe exit that the framework calls is interface IF_EDOC_IS_RELEVANT_CLOUD; its single method IS_RELEVANT delivers the Boolean flag EDOC_TW_RELEVANT_RESULT (initial value = result of SAP standard check).  \nIf your implementation changes that flag to abap_false the framework returns immediately and no eDocument is created nor stored in table EDOCUMENT.\n\nBelow is a minimal, working sample taken from the delivered demo class CL_EDOC_TW_IS_RELEVANT_SAMPLE.  \nYou can copy it, replace the condition block with your own business rules and activate it in the enhancement spot EDOC_IS_RELEVANT_CLOUD (BAdI definition EDOC_IS_RELEVANT):\n\n```abap\nCLASS zcl_my_edoc_relevance IMPLEMENTATION.\n  METHOD if_edoc_is_relevant_cloud~is_relevant.\n\n    \"1) keep the result coming from SAP standard\n    edoc_tw_relevant_result = edoc_tw_relevant.        \"initial value\n\n    \"2) read the source-document data that the framework passed in\n    DATA lv_tax_code TYPE mwskz.\n    DATA lv_doc_type TYPE blart.\n\n    IF edoc_tw_sd_data IS NOT INITIAL.\n      lv_doc_type = edoc_tw_sd_data-bkpf-blart.\n      LOOP AT edoc_tw_sd_data-conditions_record INTO DATA(ls_cond).\n        IF ls_cond-koaid = 'D'.\n          lv_tax_code = ls_cond-mwsk1.\n          EXIT.\n        ENDIF.\n      ENDLOOP.\n    ELSEIF edoc_tw_fi_data IS NOT INITIAL.\n      lv_doc_type = edoc_tw_fi_data-document_header-blart.\n      LOOP AT edoc_tw_fi_data-document_item INTO DATA(ls_item).\n        IF ls_item-koart = 'D'.\n          lv_tax_code = ls_item-mwskz.\n          EXIT.\n        ENDIF.\n      ENDLOOP.\n    ENDIF.\n\n    \"3) company-specific check:\n    \"   – do NOT create an eDocument when document type = ‘XX’\n    \"     AND tax code = ‘XX’\n    IF lv_doc_type = 'XX' AND lv_tax_code = 'XX'.\n      edoc_tw_relevant_result = abap_false.            \" => skip creation\n      RETURN.\n    ENDIF.\n\n    \"4) extra example – skip if the GUI number is syntactically wrong\n    DATA lv_gui TYPE xblnr_v1.\n    IF edoc_tw_sd_data-document_header-xblnr IS NOT INITIAL.\n      lv_gui = edoc_tw_sd_data-document_header-xblnr.\n    ELSEIF edoc_tw_fi_data-document_header-xblnr IS NOT INITIAL.\n      lv_gui = edoc_tw_fi_data-document_header-xblnr.\n    ENDIF.\n\n    IF edoc_tw_relevant_result = abap_true AND\n       ( strlen( lv_gui ) <> 10 OR\n         lv_gui+0(2)  CA '[^A-Z]' OR\n         lv_gui+2(8)  CA '[^0-9]' ).\n      edoc_tw_relevant_result = abap_false.\n    ENDIF.\n\n  ENDMETHOD.\nENDCLASS.\n```\n\nHow to use  \n1.

Verify that the XML really needs to be changed (AADE interface documentation).  \n2. If it does, raise an SAP incident (component CA-EDO-GR) describing the legal/ business requirement.  \n3.

         "Technical explanation\n• The e-mail that leaves the “Manage Electronic Document” app is built in class CL_EDOCUMENT_TR (method SEND_EMAIL_TO_CUST).  \n• Just before the actual send-out (CL_EDOC_UTIL=>SEND_EMAIL) the framework calls a released Cloud BAdI that was designed exactly for customer extensions:\n\n   – EDOC_PART_CONN_CHANGE_EMAIL_V2    (new default)  \n   – EDOC_PART_CONN_CHANGE_EMAIL        (older; still usable, but V2 has no nesting-table limits)\n\n• Both BAdIs are filterable by Country (= ‘DE’) and a Generic Filter, so you can target only German customer-invoice e-mails.\n\n• SAP already ships a reference implementation in class CL_EDC_PART_CONN_CHANGE_EMAIL; the method IF_EDC_PART_CONN_CHANGE_EMAIL~CHANGE_EMAIL shows every field you can overwrite (sender, subject, body text, TO/CC lists, attachments, virus-scan profile, importance, etc.).\n\nHow to implement in Public Cloud\n1. In your S/4HANA Cloud tenant open “Custom Logic” (app F1481).  \n2. Create a new enhancement implementation:  \n   • Business Context  Electronic Document  \n   • BAdI Name     EDOC_PART_CONN_CHANGE_EMAIL_V2  \n   • Filter Country   DE  \n3. In the generated ABAP class copy only the lines you need from SAP’s sample (see code snippet below) and add your own logic – e.g. change the subject or append a marketing PDF.  \n4. Activate and transport. No configuration, no whitelisting of APIs is required.\n\nExample snippet (minimal)\n```\nMETHOD if_edc_part_conn_change_email_v2~change_email.\n\n  \"add a custom subject line\n  CONCATENATE 'Rechnung ' edocument-source_key\n              format( edocument-create_date AS DATE ) INTO emailsubject\n              SEPARATED BY space.\n\n  \"prepend greeting text\n  emailcontenttext = VALUE #( BASE emailcontenttext\n                              ( |Sehr geehrte Damen und Herren,| )\n                              ( |anbei Ihre elektronische Rechnung.| )\n                              ( '' ) ).               \"blank line\n\n  \"add additional recipient\n  APPEND 'cc-team@mycompany.de' TO emailrecipientscc.\n\n  \"attach a company brochure (already stored as MIME object)\n  DATA pdf_xstr TYPE xstring.\n  pdf_xstr = cl_mime_repository_api=>get( '/SAP/BC/BROCHURE.PDF' ).\n  APPEND VALUE edoc_email_attachment(\n         attachm_subject = 'Broschuere'\n         attachm_type    = 'PDF'\n         content_hex     = cl_document_bcs=>xstring_to_solix( pdf_xstr )\n         attachm_size    = xstrlen( pdf_xstr ) ) TO attachments.\n\nENDMETHOD.\n```\n\nResult\nEvery customer invoice e-mail sent for German companies now carries the modified subject, body, extra CC recipient and new attachment.\n\nPlain-language takeaway\nUse Cloud BAdI EDOC_PART_CONN_CHANGE_EMAIL_V2 (via the “Custom Logic” app) to programmatically change anything in the customer e-mail that goes out of the Manage Electronic Document app.",

         "TECHNICAL EXPLANATION  \n1. Where the e-mail is built  \n   • Every time you press “Send E-mail” (or the process sends it automatically) the framework calls  \n     CL_EDOCUMENT…->SEND_EMAIL_TO_CUST → CL_EDOC_UTIL=>SEND_EMAIL.  \n   • Just before the e-mail is handed over, the framework looks for the cloud BAdI  \n     – EDOC_PART_CONN_CHANGE_EMAIL_V2 (new, preferred)  \n     – EDOC_PART_CONN_CHANGE_EMAIL      (old, still called if V2 has no implementation)  \n     (see the ABAP extract returned by the tool call – lines “GET BADI lo_part_conn_cloud_v2 …”).  \n   • If you provide an implementation, the method CHANGE_EMAIL_TO_CUSTOMER is executed and you\n     can overwrite almost every field of the message (sender, recipients, subject, body, language,\n     sensitivity, virus-scan profile, attachments, “send immediately” flag, …).  \n\n2. What you are allowed to change in a Public-Cloud system  \n   • You cannot modify the standard classes, but the BAdI is released for key-user\n     (In-App/Extensibility) coding.  \n   • No classic SO10 mail forms exist – the BAdI is the single enhancement point.  \n   • Attachment size and number are still checked by the framework (≤ 10 MB total).  \n\nHOW-TO STEPS  \n1. Open app “Custom Logic” (or “Business Add-Ins (BAdI)” in the Extensibility catalog).  \n2. Search for BAdI name “EDOC_PART_CONN_CHANGE_EMAIL_V2 – Change e-mail to customer (v2)”.  \n3. Create a new implementation.  \n4. Maintain the filter values:  \n   • Country             – the country of the eDocument you want to influence (e.g. “BR”).  \n   • Generic Filter      – only if you use more than one interface connector; otherwise ‘*’.  \n5. Implement method CHANGE_EMAIL_TO_CUSTOMER, e.g.\n\n```\nMETHOD if_edoc_part_conn_change_email_v2~change_email_to_customer.\n  \"Set sender (prefilled with company address #1)\n  emailsender = |noreply@mycompany.com|.\n\n  \"Replace the subject\n  emailsubject = |eInvoice { edocument-source_key }|.\n\n  \"Rewrite message text\n  CLEAR emailcontenttext.\n  APPEND |Dear Customer,|                          TO emailcontenttext.\n  APPEND |Please find attached your electronic | &\n         |invoice { edocument-source_key }.|        TO emailcontenttext.\n  APPEND |Kind regards,| TO emailcontenttext.\n\n  \"Attach only the signed XML, drop the PDF\n  DELETE attachments WHERE attachm_type = 'PDF'.\n\n  \"Add an extra PDF created elsewhere (optional)\n* attachments = VALUE #( BASE attachments\n*                       ( attachm_type     = 'PDF'\n*                         attachm_subject  = |Guide_{ edocument-source_key }|\n*                         content_hex      = lv_pdf_xstring\n*                         attachm_size     = xstrlen( lv_pdf_xstring ) ) ).\nENDMETHOD.\n```\n\n6. Activate and transport (the key-user transport is created automatically).  \n7. Test from app “Manage Electronic Document”; the mail should now use your content.  \n\nIF YOU ARE ON AN OLDER RELEASE (< 2302)  \nIf the new BAdI is not offered, implement the predecessor EDOC_PART_CONN_CHANGE_EMAIL\n(the parameters are almost identical, but only one attachment is supported).  \n\nPlain-language takeaway  \nUse the cloud BAdI “EDOC_PART_CONN_CHANGE_EMAIL_V2” in the Custom Logic app to\noverwrite sender, recipients, subject, body text or attachments of the e-mail that the\nManage Electronic Document app sends to your customers—no other enhancement option is\nneeded in Public Cloud.",

         "Technical explanation (step-by-step)\n\n1. Prerequisites  \n   • Your S/4HANA Public-Cloud tenant is enabled for “Developer Extensibility” and you log on with a user that has the role SAP_BR_DEVELOPER.  \n   • Latest ADT (Eclipse) plug-in is installed and an ABAP Cloud Project is created that points to the client 080 (development client) of the tenant.\n\n2. Create the enhancement implementation in ADT  \n   a. In the Project Explorer choose: New  →  ABAP Repository Object  →  Enhancement Implementation.  \n   b. Enhancement Spot     : ES_EDOC_PARTNER_CONNECTOR  \n   c. BAdI Definition      : EDOC_PART_CONN_CHANGE_EMAIL_V2  \n   d. Implementation Name  : Z_EDOC_PART_CONN_CHANGE_EML_V2 (or any Z* / Y* name)  \n   e. Short Text           : “Change e-mail generated by eDocument Partner Connector”.  \n   f. Package              : Your local package (e.g., ZLOCAL) and transport request.  \n   ADT generates a new class (e.g., ZCL_EDOC_PART_CONN_CHG_EML_V2) that already implements interface IF_EDC_PART_CONN_CHANGE_EMAIL (same interface is used in *…_V2*).\n\n3. Maintain filter values (mandatory for the framework to call your implementation)  \n   • COUNTRY      (EDOCUMENT-LAND): e.g., “DE” – or “*” for all countries.  \n   • GENERIC_FILT (generic_filter) : blank or your own distinguishing value if you have more than one implementation.  \n   You enter the values in the “Enh. Implementation → Filters” tab in ADT and activate.\n\n4. Implement method CHANGE_EMAIL  \n   ADT created a stub for IF_EDC_PART_CONN_CHANGE_EMAIL~CHANGE_EMAIL.  \n   Use SAP’s delivered example class CL_EDC_PART_CONN_CHANGE_EMAIL as a template (tool output excerpt):\n\n```abap\nMETHOD if_edc_part_conn_change_email~change_email.\n  DATA: lv_sender       LIKE LINE OF companyemailaddresses,\n        lv_recipient_to LIKE LINE OF customeremailaddresses,\n        ls_content_line LIKE LINE OF emailcontenttext.\n\n* Sender (first company e-mail maintained in T001/ADR6)\n  READ TABLE companyemailaddresses INTO lv_sender INDEX 1.\n  emailsender = lv_sender-smtp_addr.\n\n* Recipients (all customer e-mails)\n  LOOP AT customeremailaddresses INTO lv_recipient_to.\n    APPEND lv_recipient_to-smtp_addr TO emailrecipientsto.\n  ENDLOOP.\n\n* Subject\n  CONCATENATE 'Invoice' edocument-source_key INTO emailsubject SEPARATED BY space.\n\n* Body (255 char per line)\n  ls_content_line = 'Dear Customer,'.\n  APPEND ls_content_line TO emailcontenttext.\n  ls_content_line = 'Please find your electronic invoice attached.'.\n  APPEND ls_content_line TO emailcontenttext.\n\nENDMETHOD.\n```\n\n   – You can also fill optional CHANGING parameters (attachments, language, importance, send-immediately flag, etc.).  \n   – Do not raise exceptions; instead return an explanatory text in parameter ERROR_TEXT (if you fill it, the framework logs it and stops processing).\n\n5. Activate the implementation  \n   Activate the class and the enhancement implementation. Activation is automatically saved in your transport request and will flow through SAP Cloud Transport Management when released.\n\n6. Test  \n   • Open the Fiori app “Manage Electronic Documents”.  \n   • Select an eDocument that should send an e-mail (“Send to Partner” action).  \n   • The framework calls your BAdI implementation; verify that sender, recipients, subject and text are set as expected.  \n   • Check application log (app “Display Application Log”) object EDOCUMENT for any ERROR_TEXT returned by the BAdI.\n\n7. Move to production  \n   Export the transport via “Export Software Collection” tile and import in the target tenant. No additional configuration is required because the filter values are stored in the enhancement implementation itself.\n\nOne-sentence plain-language summary  \nCreate a new enhancement implementation for BAdI EDOC_PART_CONN_CHANGE_EMAIL_V2 in Eclipse, maintain the country/filter values, code your logic in method CHANGE_EMAIL (copying SAP’s sample class), activate and transport—the framework then calls your code to change sender, recipients, subject and content of the e-mail that the eDocument partner connector sends.",

         "Technical explanation\n• In S/4HANA Public Cloud the mail that is sent to a customer is built by the e-Document framework.  \n• The framework determines the attachments in method CL_EDOCUMENT_**…**→SET_EMAIL_ATTACHMENTS (see tool output).  \n  – The method takes the XML that was created for the e-invoice and—if available—the automatically generated PDF/A-3 file and adds them to an internal table ET_ATTACHMENT.  \n  – The table is returned to the Business Communication Service (BCS) and the mail is sent.  \n• The source code shows no parameter or BAdI that would let an application or key user append further, arbitrary files.  \n• In S/4HANA Public Cloud customer specific enhancements (implicit/explicit enhancements, custom ABAP, classic BAdIs) are not allowed; only the pre-delivered cloud‐released extension points can be used, and none of those provide an “add extra mail attachment” hook for output e-mails.  \n• Therefore the only files that can travel with the mail are the ones that the framework itself creates (XML, PDF/A-3, cleared-response ZIP, etc.). End-users cannot upload or inject additional files such as T&Cs, images, spreadsheets, etc.\n\nExample from method CL_EDOCUMENT_SA→SET_EMAIL_ATTACHMENTS   (tool excerpt)\n  LOOP AT lt_attachment.  \n      <ls_attachment>-attachm_type = ‘XML’ | ‘PDF’.    \"system-generated only  \n  ENDLOOP.\n\nSince the attachment list is built programmatically and is not exposed for modification, additional user documents can’t be appended.\n\nPlain-language answer\nNo – in the S/4HANA Public Cloud edition you cannot attach extra files to the e-mails that the system sends to customers; only the system-generated XML/PDF of the electronic invoice are sent.",

         "Technical explanation\n1. During e-mail creation the SAP standard routines build an internal table     ct_email_attachments (type ­edoc_email_attachment_tab).  \n   Each line represents one attachment that is later forwarded to\n   CL_BCS → CL_DOCUMENT_BCS->add_attachment( … ).  \n   Fields that have to be filled are at minimum  \n      • ATTACHM_TYPE     (‘PDF’, ‘XML’, ‘TXT’ …)  \n      • ATTACHM_SUBJECT  (File name without extension)  \n      • CONTENT_HEX      (the file in XSTRING → SOLIX format)  \n      • ATTACHM_SIZE     (Size in bytes).\n\n2. SAP explicitly allows partners to change that table in BAdIs\n   – for outgoing customer e-mails the classical place is method\n     IF_EDOC_PARTNER_CONNECTOR~CHANGE_EMAIL_TO_CUSTOMER\n     (see call in CL_EDOCUMENT_CO_UBL_21→send_email_to_cust).  \n   – for generic mail processes the method IF_EDOC_CHANGE_EMAIL~GET_EMAIL_CHANGES\n     is used (see CL_EDOC_UTIL→send_email).\n\n3. Therefore, to attach another PDF you only have to implement the BAdI and\n   append a new line to ct_email_attachments.\n\nSample enhancement (BAdI implementation)\n\n```\nMETHOD if_edoc_partner_connector~change_email_to_customer.\n\n*------------------------------------------------*\n* 1. build / read the PDF you want to send       *\n*------------------------------------------------*\n  DATA: lv_pdf_xstr TYPE xstring,\n        lt_pdf_solix TYPE solix_tab,\n        lv_size      TYPE so_obj_len.\n\n* (a) example: read PDF from MIME repository\n  DATA(lo_mime) = cl_mime_repository_api=>get_api( ).\n  lo_mime->get( EXPORTING i_url    = '/SAP/PUBLIC/ATTACHMENTS/TERMS.PDF'\n                 IMPORTING e_content = lv_pdf_xstr ).\n\n* (b) convert XSTRING → SOLIX table that BCS expects\n  lt_pdf_solix = cl_document_bcs=>xstring_to_solix( lv_pdf_xstr ).\n  lv_size      = xstrlen( lv_pdf_xstr ).\n\n*------------------------------------------------*\n* 2. append new line to attachment table         *\n*------------------------------------------------*\n  DATA ls_attach TYPE edoc_email_attachment.\n\n  ls_attach-attachm_type    = 'PDF'.               \" File type\n  ls_attach-attachm_subject = 'Terms_and_Conditions'. \" File name (no ext.)\n  ls_attach-content_hex     = lt_pdf_solix.\n  ls_attach-attachm_size    = lv_size.\n\n  APPEND ls_attach TO ct_email_attachments.\n\n*------------------------------------------------*\n* 3. done – rest of the parameters are kept      *\n*------------------------------------------------*\n\nENDMETHOD.\n```\n\nHow it works\n• The BAdI method is executed after the standard program has already compiled the e-mail.  \n• By appending to ct_email_attachments you piggy-back on the existing\n  CL_DOCUMENT_BCS call; no further coding is required.  \n• If you need the PDF to be generated on-the-fly (e.g. from a spool\n  request or SmartForm) simply replace step 1 with your own PDF-creation\n  logic and fill lv_pdf_xstr accordingly.\n\nPlain-language summary\nImplement the provided BAdI and, in its CHANGE_EMAIL_TO_CUSTOMER method,\nadd one extra line to the attachment table with your PDF; SAP’s own e-mail\nframework will automatically add the new PDF file to every customer mail.",

         "Technical explanation  \nThe ABAP framework class cl_edocument_ext first calls determine_prereq_for_process before it ever creates a new Process Manager object (method create_procmgr).  \nAll country-specific subclasses that override determine_prereq_for_process perform the same checks:\n\n• cl_edocument_fr_erep  \n  – If the eDocument is an eDocument-List (source type = EDOC_LIST) and still has the dummy GUID, it must already know the Logical System (LOGSYS).  \n  – The routine therefore derives and sets LOGSYS before the Process can be created.  \n\n• cl_edocument_svn (and identically cl_edocument_it)  \n  – If the interface type (INTERFACE_TYPE) is still initial, the method first determines and fills the correct interface type.  \n  – A Process can only be created once INTERFACE_TYPE is set.\n\nIf these fields are not filled, create_procmgr immediately stops (mv_procmgr_active = abap_false OR PREREQ missing) and no Process object is instantiated.\n\nTherefore, in the Public (cloud) version the mandatory prerequisites for creating a new Process for DRC extensibility are:\n\n1. A Logical System (LOGSYS) is available for eDocument-List scenarios.  \n2. The eDocument’s Interface Type (INTERFACE_TYPE) is determined and not initial.\n\nPlain-language summary  \nBefore you can create a new DRC-extensibility Process, make sure the eDocument already has (1) a logical system set (when you work with document lists) and (2) a valid interface type; otherwise the framework will refuse to create the Process object.",

         "Technical explanation (key facts coming from the code search)  \n• Every “public-cloud” DRC process looks-up the technical route for an outbound call in one of two places:  \n  – Class CL_EDOC_UTIL_EU → method GET_COMMUNICATION_SCENARIO (for EU-type processes).  \n  – Country/region-specific class that implements IF_EDOC_LAC_COMM → method IF_EDOC_LAC_COMM~GET_COMMUNICATION_DATA (e.g. CL_EDOC_LAC_COMM_CO, …).  \n  These methods return a structure that contains four fields which together define a communication interface for DRC in SAP S/4HANA Cloud:  \n      interface_id   (e.g. ‘CO_INVOICE_TRANSM’)  \n      version        (numeric, 0001 …)  \n      scenario_id    (a Communication Scenario, e.g. ‘SAP_COM_0670’)  \n      service_id     (service inside the scenario, e.g. ‘0001’)  \n\n• When a new custom process is created you therefore have to make sure that the same four data points exist (and match) in both – the ABAP layer and the Communication‐Management layer of the tenant.\n\nStep-by-step procedure to “Define Communication Interface in Public” for a new custom DRC process  \n1. Design the interface parameters  \n   – Decide on an Interface ID (18 chars max, UPPER-CASE, no spaces).  \n   – Decide how many versions you will need (normally start with 0001).  \n   – Decide which outbound technology you will use (SOAP / REST).  \n2. Create the Communication Scenario (UI: “Custom Communication Scenarios”)  \n   a. Include each outbound service you need.  \n   b. Publish the scenario → this yields a Scenario-ID ( ‘Z_…’ if you create it yourself).  \n   c. Each service created in the scenario receives a Service-ID (0001, 0002 …).  \n3. Create a Communication System (UI: “Communication Systems”)  \n   – Enter host, port, authentication method for your external platform.  \n4. Create a Communication Arrangement (UI: “Communication Arrangements”)  \n   – Base it on the scenario you made in step 2.  \n   – Bind the services to the system from step 3.  \n   – Note the logical port (= generated outbound service name).  \n5. Register the interface on the ABAP side (Configuration activity “Define Interface” – SSCUI 106641)  \n   – Enter Interface-ID, Version and mark it as “Public”.  \n   – Specify technology (SOAP / REST), HTTP method, relative URL path, MIME type, etc.  \n6. Map interface ↔ process step (Configuration activity “Assign Interface to Process Step” – SSCUI 106642).  \n7. Tell the runtime which Communication Scenario / Service to use  \n   (the part proven by the code snippets above)  \n   – Add a record to the IF_EDOC_LAC_COMM implementation that belongs to your country/cluster.  \n     Example (pattern taken from CL_EDOC_LAC_COMM_CO):  \n       result = VALUE ts_comm_data(  \n          ( interface_id = ‘Z_MY_CUSTOM_TRANSM’  \n            version      = 0001  \n            service_id   = 0001  \n            scenario_id  = ‘Z_MY_SCENARIO’ ) ).  \n   – If your process is EU-type, instead extend the internal table GT_COMMUNICATION_SCENARIO inside CL_EDOC_UTIL_EU~GET_COMMUNICATION_SCENARIO in exactly the same way.  \n8. Transport / deploy the enhancement to your Quality & Production tenants.  \n9. Test the call with “Preview XML / Test Run” in the Manage Electronic Documents app – the system now resolves:  \n   Process step → Interface ID/Version → Scenario/Service → Logical-Port → actual endpoint.\n\nShort example snippet (taken from CL_EDOC_LAC_COMM_CO)  \n  result = VALUE #(  \n      ( interface_id = ‘CO_INVOICE_TRANSM’      version = 0001  \n        service_id  = 0001  scenario_id = ‘SAP_COM_0670’ ) ).\n\nPlain-language summary  \nIn public-cloud DRC you first build a Communication Scenario/Arrangement in the UI, then register the same IDs in configuration (Define Interface + Assign Interface) and finally expose them to the runtime by adding one line of ABAP mapping (interface-id → scenario/service). Once those four values line up, your new custom process can reach the external platform.",

         "Technical explanation – end-to-end procedure in S/4HANA Cloud, public edition  \n\n1. Check authorizations  \n   • User must have business role BR_DRC_CONFIG (or a custom role containing the same _DRC Process Configuration_ catalog).  \n   • If you will upload test files or simulate, add BR_DRC_EXPERT.\n\n2. Prepare master data  \n   • Make sure the Italian company code is assigned to a Reporting Entity in app “Manage Reporting Entities”.  \n   • Verify tax numbers and digital address (Codice Destinatario) are maintained for the entity; these are reused by DRC run-time.  \n\n3. Open the configuration cockpit  \n   • Launch Fiori app “Define Compliance Processes”.  \n   • Click + Create → choose “Process” and enter:  \n       – Process ID (technical key, e.g. ZIT_FPA_OUT)  \n       – Description (e.g. “FatturaPA Outbound Italy”)  \n       – Country/Region = IT  \n       – Process Type = Outbound (or Inbound if relevant)\n\n4. Start with an empty version  \n   • The system creates Version 001 automatically. You may copy an SAP-delivered template (e.g. BUS_IT_FPA) instead of starting blank; this keeps the process extensible yet linked to SAP updates.  \n\n5. Define Extraction step (“Data Source”)  \n   • Tab “Extraction”: select CDS view or RAP query delivering the raw data.  \n   • For invoices you can reference I_BILLINGDOCJEE or your own custom CDS created in key-user extensibility (“Custom CDS Views”).  \n   • Enter selection parameters to expose on the run screen (company code, fiscal year, document number, etc.).\n\n6. Add Transformation / Mapping  \n   • Tab “Transformation”: choose Mapping Type = Mapping Logic.  \n   • If you copied an SAP process the delivered XSLT/BRF+ rule is already listed; otherwise upload your own XSLT or maintain a BRF+ function that converts the extraction structure to the Italian FatturaPA XML (or whatever custom layout you need).  \n\n7. Configure Validation (optional but common)  \n   • Tab “Validation”: point to CDS or BRF+ function that performs Italian e-invoicing checks (mandatory tags, decimal formats, etc.).  \n   • Set severity (Error/Warning) so that incorrect documents are blocked before submission.\n\n8. Output Definition  \n   • Tab “Output Handling”:  \n       – Output Channel = PEPPOL/SDI/External System/File Download depending on customer landscape.  \n       – Define file naming convention, compression, or e-mail destination if using e-mail adapter.  \n       – For Public Cloud you normally pick “Communication Arrangement” and reference SAP Document Compliance, Italy (SAP_COM_0601).  \n\n9. Assign Process to Reporting Entity  \n   • Switch to app “Assign Processes to Reporting Entities”.  \n   • Select your Italian entity and tick the newly created process/version 001 so that it appears in run cockpit.\n\n10. Transport to Q and P systems  \n   • In Public Cloud, configuration is recorded automatically. Use “Export / Import Compliance Content” to move from Dev tenant to Test → Prod.\n\n11. Test run  \n   • Open “Run Compliance Processes”.  \n   • Filter by entity and your new process.  \n   • Execute with a small selection; verify extraction log, mapping result, and produced XML in the “Messages” section.  \n\n12. Activate for production  \n   • When results are correct, set the process version status to “Released” in Define Compliance Processes.  \n   • Schedule a job via “Schedule Compliance Jobs” or integrate with SD billing output to trigger the DRC run automatically.\n\nPlain-language summary  \nCreate the new Italian process in the “Define Compliance Processes” Fiori app, point it to the data source, mapping, validation, and output you need, then link it to your Italian reporting entity and test; once it runs correctly, release and transport it to production.",

         "Technical explanation (Public-Cloud DRC framework)  \n1. Create the implementation class  \n   • In Eclipse/ADT choose File → New → ABAP Class.  \n   • Name it ZCL_DRC_XX_COUNTRY (XX = ISO code).  \n   • Set Super-Class to CL_DRC_EX_COUNTRY_HDLR (standard abstract class that contains all default hooks).  \n   • No additional interface declaration is needed; the super class already defines every exit method (BUILD_HEADER, BUILD_SUPPLIER_NODE, MAP_TAXES, AFTER_SIGNATURE, etc.).  \n\n2. Override only the exits you really need  \n   • Redefine the relevant protected methods; leave the others untouched so the framework keeps the SAP default logic. Example:  \n     METHOD build_supplier_node.  \n       super->build_supplier_node( ).       \"keeps common logic  \n       “–– country specific add-ons  \n       lr_xml->add_attribute( iv_name = 'State' iv_value = 'DF' ).  \n     ENDMETHOD.  \n\n3. Transport class to the tenant  \n   • Use gCTS to commit & push to the central repository.  \n   • In Public Cloud the transport container is released automatically once the change is pushed.  \n\n4. Register the handler for the country/region in the “Manage DRC Extensibility” app  \n   • Go to SAP Fiori tile “Document and Reporting Compliance – Extensibility”.  \n   • Choose “Country/Region Handlers” → “New”.  \n   • Enter:  \n     ‑ Country/Region = BR (example)  \n     ‑ Business Process = E-Invoicing (EDOC) or Reporting as required  \n     ‑ Class Name = ZCL_DRC_BR_COUNTRY  \n   • Save and activate; the framework now calls your class whenever it processes documents for that country.  \n\n5. (Optional) Provide test data variants  \n   • In the same app choose “Simulation Variants” and assign your class to XML test files; this lets you run the built-in simulator without posting real documents.  \n\n6. Life-cycle tasks  \n   • Versioning – Create new inactive versions when legal rules change; activate at go-live date.  \n   • Regression – Use the built-in unit-test class that comes with CL_DRC_EX_COUNTRY_HDLR; simply redefine IF_DRC_TEST~RUN.  \n\nPlain-language summary  \nCreate a subclass of SAP’s standard country-handler base class, override only the mapping methods you need, transport it, and register the class for the desired country in the “Manage DRC Extensibility” Fiori app—then the Public-Cloud DRC framework will automatically run your logic for all documents of that country.",

         "Technical explanation  \n• SAP S/4HANA Cloud, public edition does NOT allow you to create an arbitrary global ABAP class and plug it somewhere in the DRC (Document & Reporting Compliance) flow.  \n• What is allowed is a key-user “Custom Logic” enhancement: you create a BAdI implementation class that must implement one of the DRC-released interfaces (all of them are in the *…_CLOUD* naming pattern).  \n• During activation Custom Logic automatically generates a class in the customer namespace ( ZCL_… ) that you can fill with ABAP for Cloud code (restricted ABAP syntax, no direct DB access, only released APIs).  \n• Typical mapping/parameter BAdIs are  \n  – EDOC_FILL_DATA_CLOUD  (interface IF_EDOC_FILL_DATA_CLOUD) – add or overwrite field values in the XML that DRC sends to the external platform.  \n  – EDOC_OUTPUT_PARAM_CLOUD (interface IF_EDOC_OUTPUT_PARAM_CLOUD) – set form names, queues, service IDs, etc.  \n  – EDOC_PROCESSING_STEP_CLOUD – hook into individual processing steps.  \n• The sample class below (shipped by SAP and visible in every public-cloud tenant) shows exactly that approach: it implements IF_EDOC_FILL_DATA_CLOUD and manipulates the mapping structure.\n\n```abap\nCLASS zcl_edoc_tw_fill_data IMPLEMENTATION.\n  METHOD if_edoc_fill_data_cloud~fill_data.\n* Your mapping logic here – you receive header/item structures and\n* can change them, or add name/value pairs to EDOC_TW_KEY\n    APPEND VALUE #( name  = 'MAIN/SELLER/PERSON_IN_CHARGE'\n                    value = 'John Doe' ) TO edoc_tw_key.\n  ENDMETHOD.\nENDCLASS.\n```\n\nHow to create it  \n1. App “Custom Logic” → Create → Business Context “Document and Reporting Compliance” → choose e.g. BAdI “EDOC_FILL_DATA_CLOUD”.  \n2. The wizard generates the ABAP class stub; you write the mapping code and publish.  \n3. No transport or developer key is needed, and the implementation is versioned and upgrade-safe.  \n\nWhat is NOT possible  \n• Creating completely new repository objects (global classes, DDIC tables) outside the BAdI framework.  \n• Using unreleased kernel statements or accessing SAP-only tables.  \n\nOne-sentence plain-language answer  \nYes—inside S/4HANA Public Cloud you can add your own mapping logic for DRC, but only as a BAdI implementation generated through the “Custom Logic” extensibility app and based on the released *…_CLOUD* interfaces, not as a free-standing custom class.",

         "The generated answer provides a detailed and mostly accurate explanation of implementing the BAdI EDOCUMENT_BASE_EXT for Spain in SAP S/4HANA Public Cloud. It covers many important aspects that align with both the expert answer and the additional context provided by the tool. However, there are some discrepancies and areas where it could be improved:\n\n1. Alignment with expert answer: The generated answer covers the main steps mentioned in the expert answer, such as creating an enhancement implementation, implementing the BAdI, setting a filter for Spain, and activating the implementation. This shows good coverage of the core requirements.\n\n2. Additional details: The generated answer provides more detailed steps and explanations than the expert answer, which is generally helpful. It includes information about prerequisites, specific class naming, and the use of the Custom Logic app, which are not mentioned in the expert answer but are relevant to the implementation process.\n\n3. Technical accuracy: The technical explanation at the beginning of the generated answer accurately describes how the BAdI is called and the role of the cv_edoc_class_name parameter, which is not explicitly mentioned in the expert answer but is crucial for understanding the process.\n\n4. Public Cloud specifics: The answer correctly addresses the Public Cloud context by mentioning the ABAP environment (Steampunk) and the use of the Custom Logic app, which are specific to the cloud implementation.\n\n5. Discrepancies:\n   - The generated answer suggests creating a new class (ZCL_EDOCUMENT_ES_CUST) and returning its name in the BAdI implementation. While this approach can work, it's not explicitly mentioned in the expert answer or the tool output, which focus more on implementing the BAdI directly.\n   - The answer mentions SSCUI 104311 and the \"Manage Electronic Document Extensibility\" app, which are not referenced in the expert answer or the tool output. While these might be relevant, their inclusion without confirmation from the provided sources raises questions about their necessity in the Public Cloud context.\n\n6. Omissions:\n   - The generated answer doesn't mention the EDOCUMENT_INT_CONN_EXT BAdI for web service communication, which is mentioned in the tool output as an important step for sending and receiving electronic documents.\n   - It doesn't explicitly mention the use of CL_EDOCUMENT_EXT_ES class for Spain-specific requirements, which is highlighted in the tool output.\n\nIn conclusion, while the generated answer provides valuable and mostly accurate information, it includes some details that are not verified by the given sources and omits some important points mentioned in the tool output.

         "Technical explanation\n• When an eDocument object is instantiated (class CL_EDOCUMENT_EXT, constructor shown in the tool output) the framework executes  \n  GET BADI mo_edocument_base_ext FILTERS country = ms_edocument-land  \n  … CALL BADI mo_edocument_base_ext→determine_edocument_class …  \n  The method must return a class name (cv_edoc_class_name).  \n• Your implementation for Spain (country code “ES”) is therefore responsible only for filling that exporting parameter; everything else (mapping class selection, XML creation, submission, etc.) is handled later by the standard runtime through the class you return.\n\nProcedure to implement BAdI EDOCUMENT_BASE_EXT for Spain in SAP S/4HANA Public Cloud\n\n1. Prerequisites  \n  a. Scope item 5XU (Advanced Compliance Reporting & eDocument Framework) is active.  \n  b. You have a key-user or developer role that allows “Custom Logic” and “ABAP Development” in the ABAP environment (Steampunk) that ships with Public Cloud.  \n\n2. Create the country-specific eDocument class  \n  a. In ADT choose File ➔ New ➔ ABAP Class.  \n  b. Name it e.g. ZCL_EDOCUMENT_ES_CUST, make it PUBLIC, final, and inherit from CL_EDOCUMENT_EXT or (better) from CL_EDOCUMENT_EXT_ES if you want to reuse SAP’s Spanish helper APIs.  \n  c. Redefine only those methods you really need (usually *determine_mapping_class*, *fill_additional_fields* etc.). Leave everything else to the superclass.  \n  d. Activate and transport (ABAP Cloud transport).  \n\n3. Implement the BAdI in “Custom Logic” app  \n  a. Open app “Custom Logic”. Press “+”.  \n  b. Business Context = “Electronic Document (eDocument)”, BAdI = EDOCUMENT_BASE_EXT, Implementation description “Determine eDocument class – Spain”.  \n  c. On the “Filter” tab maintain Country = ES.  \n  d. Paste code similar to:  \n\n```\nMETHOD determine_edocument_class.\n  \"Only executed for ES because of filter\"\n  cv_edoc_class_name = 'ZCL_EDOCUMENT_ES_CUST'.\nENDMETHOD.\n```  \n\n  e. Check → Publish. The logic is now active in your tenant.\n\n4. Register the class in SSCUI 104311 (if offered)  \n   App “Manage Electronic Document Extensibility” → “Maintain Class Names for Extended eDocument”.  \n  Insert line: Country = ES, Class = ZCL_EDOCUMENT_ES_CUST. (Some tenants skip this step; the BAdI alone is sufficient.)\n\n5. Test  \n  a. Create a Spanish source document (FI invoice, SD billing …).  \n  b. Run “Create eDocument” or scheduled job.  \n  c. In app “eDocument Cockpit” open the document, choose “Display Log” → you should see your class name in section “Class Determination”.  \n  d. Submit to tax authority or simulate; the XML is built with your class.\n\n6. Transport to production via Cloud TMS.\n\nShort example – full implementation object list  \n• Class ZCL_EDOCUMENT_ES_CUST (ABAP Cloud) – inherits CL_EDOCUMENT_EXT_ES  \n• Custom Logic implementation EDOCUMENT_BASE_EXT with country filter ES  \n• (Optionally) SSCUI entry in EDOEXTCOUNTRYCLS table\n\nOne-sentence plain-language summary\nCreate your own class that extends the SAP Spanish eDocument class, then use Custom Logic to implement BAdI EDOCUMENT_BASE_EXT with filter Country=ES and simply return that class name; afterwards the standard framework automatically calls your code whenever a Spanish eDocument is built in Public Cloud.",

         "Technical explanation  \n• For most countries SAP provides a country-specific BAdI (e.g. EDOC_IT_XML_FILE, EDOC_HU_XML_FILE, EDOC_CH_XML_FILE) that is explicitly called in the mapping classes via methods CALL_BADI_XML_FILE / CALL_CLOUD_BADIS just before the XML is handed over to the interface layer (see e.g. cl_edoc_map_it-call_badi_xml_file).  \n• A codebase search over all *GR* (Greece) mapping and interface classes – cl_edoc_map_gr_*, cl_edocument_gr, cl_edoc_intf_conn_gr – shows **no** invocation of those BAdI helper methods, nor any Greece-specific “EDOC_GR_XML_FILE” BAdI definition.  \n• Consequently, in the Greece customer-invoice flow the XML is produced in cl_edocument_gr→generate_xml and is forwarded directly to CI/CPI; there is no enhancement spot where customer code can be injected.  \n• SAP intentionally keeps the Greece (“AADE MyDATA”) payload locked because even minor structure changes make the document fail AADE validation. Enhancement options are therefore restricted to:  \n  – Changing values through standard configuration (e.g. VAT mapping tables, document types).  \n  – Post-processing in SAP Cloud Integration (mapping step) – outside the ERP system.  \n  – Adding files to the eDocument (add_xml_to_edocumentfile) after submission, which does not alter the transmitted XML.\n\nAnswer to the question  \nNo – inside SAP ERP/S/4HANA you cannot enhance or extend the Greece customer-invoice XML before it is sent to the authorities. Unlike other countries, the Greece solution has no BAdI or user-exit for XML manipulation; any alterations would have to be done externally in the middleware, not in the ERP XML generator.\n\nPlain-language summary  \nSAP deliberately offers no user exit to change the Greece e-invoice XML; you would need to keep the standard XML or adjust it later in CPI, but not within the ERP system itself.",

         "3",
         "Technical explanation (Private Cloud):\n\n1. Where the framework looks for extra files  \n   • Every country-specific mapping class contains a routine named call_badi_attachment (see class CL_EDOC_MAP_IT, line “… CALL BADI lo_conn_cloud_it->fill_attachment …”, tool output above).  \n   • The routine is executed automatically when the XML is built.  \n   • If a Cloud BAdI implementation exists, its return table is read and each entry is converted into an EDOCUMENTFILE record by helper method _prepare_edocument_file from class CL_EDOC_CO_SEND_CUST_ATTACH.  \n   • The resulting record is stored in table EDOCUMENTFILE and embedded in the XML as an <Attachment> / <AdditionalDocumentReference> element before the file is sent.\n\n2. What you have to do  \n   a. Open the “Custom Logic” Fiori app (or transaction SCFD_EUI) and create an implementation of the Cloud BAdI that is offered for your country:  \n      – Italy         : BAdI name EDOC_IT_ATTACHMENT  \n      – Colombia   : EDOC_CO_ATTACHMENT  \n      – UBL 2.1 generic: EDOC_CO_SEND_CUST_ATTACH, etc.  \n      (The BAdI names correspond 1:1 to the classes found in the code search above.)  \n\n   b. Implement method FILL_ATTACHMENT.  \n      Interface types are delivered in package EDOCUMENT_xx (see IF_EDOC_IT_CLOUD_DATATYPES):  \n\n      CHANGING attachments TYPE mty_allegati_t      \"table delivered by SAP  \n\n      Sample implementation:  \n\n      DATA ls_att TYPE if_edoc_it_cloud_datatypes=>mty_allegati_s.  \n      ls_att-nome_attachment      = ‘InvoiceScan.pdf’.  \n      ls_att-formato_attachment   = ‘PDF’.            \"shown in XML  \n      ls_att-attachment_base64    = cl_http_utility=>encode_base64( my_pdf_xstring ).  \n      APPEND ls_att TO attachments.  \n\n      RETURN.  \n\n   c. Activate the BAdI implementation.\n\n3. Runtime result  \n   • During XML creation the framework calls your BAdI, receives table ATTACHMENTS, converts the Base64 payload into an xstring, and runs method attach_file (CL_EDOCUMENT_BR_IN) to insert the entry into EDOCUMENTFILE.  \n   • The entry is picked up by the mapping routine and inserted into the outgoing XML under the node prescribed by the local standard (Allegati, AdditionalDocumentReference, etc.).  \n   • The file is therefore sent together with the main XML through the standard transmission channel (PEPPOL, SDI, etc.).\n\nMinimal working example (Italy, FatturaPA):\n\nMETHOD if_ex_edoc_it_attachment~fill_attachment.  \n  DATA ls_att TYPE if_edoc_it_cloud_datatypes=>mty_allegati_s.  \n  ls_att-nome_attachment        = ‘Contract123.pdf’.  \n  ls_att-formato_attachment     = ‘PDF’.  \n  ls_att-descrizione_attachment = ‘Signed contract’.  \n  ls_att-attachment_base64      = cl_http_utility=>encode_base64( lv_contract_xstring ).  \n  APPEND ls_att TO attachments.  \nENDMETHOD.\n\nOne-sentence summary:  \nIn a Private-Cloud system you add extra files to the standard XML by creating a Cloud BAdI implementation (e.g. EDOC_IT_ATTACHMENT) that returns the files in Base64; the Document & Reporting Compliance framework automatically converts them into EDOCUMENTFILE entries and embeds them in the outgoing XML.",

         "Technical explanation  \nIn SAP S/4HANA Document & Reporting Compliance (DRC) you can add “Custom Fields and Logic” to the eDocument data model (tables EDOC_HEADER / EDOC_ITEM, CDS views, XML mapping, etc.).  \nHowever, the cockpit-level visibility of an electronic document is governed only by the standard authorization objects delivered with DRC, mainly:\n\n• F_EDOC_OBJ – eDocument object type  \n• F_EDOC_BUK – Company-code dependent access  \n• F_EDOC_STA – Processing status\n\nThose authorization objects are hard-coded in the Fiori app “Manage Electronic Documents” and in the ABAP classes that fetch the worklist. They do not contain customer-defined fields, and in the S/4HANA Private-Cloud Edition you cannot enhance SAP authorization objects or add new fields to them without a modification, which is not allowed in PCE.\n\nTherefore a custom field created via the DRC extensibility framework can be used for reporting, XML-mapping or BAdI logic, but it cannot be turned into an additional authorization dimension for hiding or showing documents in the cockpit.\n\nWork-arounds (no modification):\n\n1. Use the existing dimensions (company code, object type) – e.g. create separate company codes or object types and set them in BAdI EDOC_PROCESSING based on your custom attribute; authorizations are then assigned on that standard field.  \n2. Prevent creation of the eDocument altogether in BAdI EDOC_ADJUST_DATA if the user is not allowed, so it never appears in the monitor.  \n3. Build a custom CDS-based list report that reads the custom field and apply CDS-level authorization (DCL) there; users work in the custom app instead of the standard cockpit.\n\nPlain-language summary  \nYou can add extra fields to an eDocument, but in the Private-Cloud version you cannot use those fields to drive who can see the document in the standard DRC cockpit; you would have to rely on company-code or object-type authorizations, or build a custom workaround.",

         "Technical explanation (SAP S/4HANA Cloud, public edition – Electronic Document Processing):\n\n1. Scope & activate the framework  \n   • In SAP Central Business Configuration select the scope item 5XK (Electronic Document Processing) and the relevant communication scenarios (e.g. SAP_COM_0632 for Peppol).  \n   • Perform the automatic transport to the test tenant; this creates the service keys and communication arrangements that the runtime will use.\n\n2. Create the electronic-document process shell  \n   • Fiori app “Define Electronic Document Processing – Process” → Create.  \n   • Enter Process ID/version, legal country, runtime class (=EDP standard), and the business document that will trigger it (e.g. SD billing).  \n   • The runtime will later pick up the correct implementation with method determine_process (see code excerpt returned from the tool for class CL_EDOCUMENT_PE → it sets ms_edocument-process according to EDOC_TYPE).\n\n3. Describe the source document  \n   • In the same app choose “Document Definition” and specify the source business object, selection criteria, key fields, and event (Posting, Change, Cancellation).\n\n4. Design the target structure  \n   • Open Segment Designer to create the target message structure (XML/JSON/UBL).  \n   • Define segments, fields, cardinality, and generate the JSON schema (saved as a segment version).\n\n5. Map source to target  \n   • Launch Mapping Designer → create a mapping version; drag-and-drop or expression-map source fields to target segments.  \n   • Where logic is too complex, implement enhancement spot EDOCUMENT_MAPPER (BAdI EDM_MAPPER) in ABAP Cloud to calculate or enrich data.\n\n6. Add validations & enrichment rules  \n   • Configure rule sets in the “Validation Rules” tab or implement BAdI EDM_VALIDATION for advanced checks.  \n   • Optional: BAdI EDM_POST_PROCESS for final enrichment (e.g. digital signature).\n\n7. Define the output & submission step  \n   • In the Process canvas add a “Submission” node and choose:  \n     – Peppol Adapter (out-of-box)  \n     – Generic HTTP, SFTP, SAP Document and Reporting Compliance service, etc.  \n   • Maintain the corresponding Communication Arrangement (user, certificate, endpoint) created in step 1.\n\n8. Assign scope & activate  \n   • In “Process Usage” assign company codes, plants, or sales orgs that must run this process.  \n   • Activate the process (status = Released); the framework stores the version in table EDOCPROCESS and makes it selectable for runtime.\n\n9. Test in the test tenant  \n   • Post an SD/FI document → check “Monitor Electronic Documents”.  \n   • Inspect mapping result (JSON/XML), validation messages, and submission log.  \n   • Adjust mappings or rules until status = “Successful”.\n\n10. Transport to production  \n    • Add the process, segment, mapping, and enhancement implementations to a Software Collection in the SAP Cloud Transport Management UI.  \n    • Export → Import into production tenant → activate.\n\n11. Operate & monitor  \n    • Schedule the job “EDP: Process Electronic Documents” (standard job template) if batch mode is required.  \n    • Use “Monitor Electronic Documents” and alerting to supervise daily processing.\n\nShort examples from tool output  \n• Class CL_EDOCUMENT_PE – method DETERMINE_PROCESS  \n  … CASE ms_edocument-edoc_type. WHEN ‘PE_BOLSUM’. ms_edocument-process = ‘PEBOLSYN’. …  \n  This illustrates how the runtime derives the correct process ID you defined in step 2.\n\nPlain-language summary:  \nEnable the scope item, create a new process in the “Define Electronic Document Processing” app, model its source, target, mapping, validations, and submission, assign it to your company codes, test, then transport it to production—after that every posted business document automatically generates and sends the required electronic document.",

         "Technical root cause  \n1. With SAP Notes 3496530 + 3496562 the method CL_EDOC_UTIL_MY→DETERMINE_EDOC_TYPE_INV_VERIF was enhanced.  \n2. For Invoice-Verification documents it now distinguishes four transaction indicators:  \n   1 = Invoice 2 = Credit Memo 3 = Subsequent Debit 4 = Subsequent Credit.  \n   (The indicator is set when field RSEG-TBTKZ = ‘X’.)  \n3. The routine then reads customizing table EDOCINVVER to convert the indicator into an eDocument type:  \n\n   ls_edoinvver = lo_edoc_config_db->select_edoinvver( iv_land = ‘MY’  \n                                                       iv_inv_tran = lv_inv_tran ).  \n\n   If no entry is found, rv_edoc_type stays INITIAL and the framework simply skips the eDocument creation – no error is raised, the CN is posted but no record appears in EDOC_COCKPIT.  \n\n4. After applying the notes you now post a “subsequent credit” (MR8M ➜ repost with “Subsequent Credit” flag).  \n   lv_inv_tran therefore = ‘4’.  \n   Because transaction 4 was introduced only with the recent notes, the corresponding entry for Malaysia is still missing in EDOCINVVER, so the system has no eDocument type to create.\n\nFix / What to do  \n1. SPRO → Cross-Application Components → Document Compliance → Country/Region-Specific Functions → Malaysia → “Maintain Transaction Types for Invoice Verification”.  \n2. Insert (or adjust) the new line:  \n\n   Country = MY  \n   Transaction (INV_TRAN) = 4   “Subsequent Credit”  \n   eDocument Type        = MY_CRESF   (or the type you use for Credit Note; in most systems SAP delivers MY_CRE for standard CN and MY_CRESF for self-billing – choose the one that matches your scenario).  \n\n3. Save and transport.  \n4. Repeat the test: cancel, repost the subsequent credit; an entry is now created in EDOC_COCKPIT and the XML is generated.\n\nPlain-language summary  \nThe two SAP Notes added a new code (“4 – Subsequent Credit”) but the related customizing was not yet filled, so the system did not know which eDocument to create and silently skipped it; add the missing line in SPRO and the Credit-Note eDocs will be generated again.",

         "Technical explanation  \n• In the XML the Tourism-Tax registration must appear as a PartyIdentification node under  \n  AccountingSupplierParty:  \n\n  <AccountingSupplierParty>  \n    <Party> …  \n      <PartyIdentification>  \n        <ID schemeID=\"TTX\"> … </ID>        ← Tourism-tax number  \n      </PartyIdentification>  \n\n• In the standard mapping this node is created only by the class hierarchy that is used for the “native” Malaysia layout (CL_EDOC_MAP_MY_INV*).  \n  For the Peppol / UBL mapping the supplier party is built in CL_EDOC_MAP_UBL_MY → CL_EDOC_MAP_UBL → CL_EDOC_MAP_UBL\\* .  \n  These classes never add an identification whose schemeID = ‘TTX’, therefore the element is missing and the XSD validator raises the error.  \n\n• Maintaining “N A” in OBY6 (Company-Code Tourism-Tax Reg.No.) is not consulted by the UBL mapping, so the value you entered never reaches the XML.  \n\nHow to solve  \nA. Apply the SAP correction (if available)  \n   – SAP Note 3359821 / support package CEI 64 SP14 (or higher) adds the missing block in method CL_EDOC_MAP_UBL_MY→FILL_SUPPLIER_PARTY.  \n   – After the note is in your system the code inserts  \n\n     ls_party_identification-id-base-base-scheme_id = ‘TTX’.  \n     ls_party_identification-id-base-base-content   = <tourism-tax-number or ‘NA’>.  \n\nB. Custom fix (if you cannot yet implement the note)  \n   1. Implement BAdI EDOC_MAP_MY_EXT (method FILL_SUPPLIER_PARTY) or enhancement spot /EDOCUMENT/UBL_MALAYSIA, add:  \n\n```abap\nDATA ls_id TYPE edo_ubl_party_identification.\nls_id-id-base-base-scheme_id  = 'TTX'.\nls_id-id-base-base-content    = 'NA'.          \"or real registration number\nAPPEND ls_id TO cs_supplier_party-party-party_identification.\n```\n\n   2. Alternatively add the code in an implicit enhancement at the end of method  \n      CL_EDOC_MAP_UBL_MY=>FILL_SUPPLIER_PARTY.  \n\nC. Where to keep the value  \n   – If you want to output the real Tourism-Tax number instead of ‘NA’, create an entry in table T001Z for the company code with Party = ‘MY_TTX’.  \n     The correction note will read the number from that place; your BAdI can do the same.  \n\nAfter one of the above steps regenerate the eDocument; the XML contains  \n\n```xml\n<AccountingSupplierParty>\n  …\n  <cac:PartyIdentification>\n     <cbc:ID schemeID=\"TTX\">NA</cbc:ID>\n  </cac:PartyIdentification>\n</AccountingSupplierParty>\n```\n\nPlain-language summary  \nThe validation fails because the delivered Peppol/UBL mapping never writes the Tourism-Tax (scheme TTX) element.  Install the SAP note that adds it, or insert the element yourself through the eDocument BAdI/enhancement; then the XML will pass validation.",

         "Technical explanation  \n• As of June 2024 SAP Document and Reporting Compliance – Malaysia e-Invoice still supports only schema version 1.0, delivered through the central implementation Note 3371326 (plus its prerequisite notes).  \n• The Malaysian Inland Revenue Board (IRBM/LHDN) published an updated e-Invoice specification “Version 1.1” on 18 April 2024, but SAP has not yet released enablement notes for this new schema.  \n• SAP normally ships such changes through an updated “central note” (same number or a new one) together with Support Package corrections. At the time of writing, no note carries corrections for schema 1.1, and Note 3371326 explicitly states “Version supported: 1.0”.  \n• The SAP Product Management statement (SAP Community post 23-Apr-2024) confirms that version 1.1 content is under development and will be provided closer to the IRBM go-live timeline.  \n• Therefore there is currently no SAP Note you can apply to “update from 1.0 to 1.1”. The recommended action is to monitor:  \n  – Central Note 3371326 – it will be updated or superseded once 1.1 is released.  \n  – SAP Launchpad KBA 3386934 (“Malaysia e-Invoice – FAQ”), which tracks upcoming deliveries.  \n  – The SAP HotNews RSS feed for component CA-GTF-CSC-EDO-MY.\n\nPlain-language summary  \nSAP has not yet shipped an update for Malaysia e-Invoice schema 1.1, so there is no SAP Note you can apply today. Keep an eye on Note 3371326 and related KBAs; SAP will publish the required update closer to the official rollout.",

         "Technical explanation  \n• Inside SAP Document & Reporting Compliance (DRC) the value for “Customs Form Reference Number” in the XML/PDF is filled by the mapping class that is called for MM-based e-invoices.  \n• Your own “Custom logic” has been switched on (BAdI EDOC_MAP_MM* or Z-copy) so that it tries to read the text object IMPORT_TEXT_TYPE from the Purchase-Order header; if no text is found there it falls back to the MIGO header text.  \n• The Mexican/Peppol UBL element ​<cac:AdditionalDocumentReference><cbc:ID schemeID=\\\"CUO\\\" …> is restricted by SAP to the regular expression  \n [A-Z0-9\\\\-\\\\.\\\\/_ ]{1,35}  \n(see constant IF_EDOC_XML_CONSTANTS=>MC_REGEX_DOC_NUMBER). Any other character (e.g. “#”, “&”, “%”, “(”, “)”, “?” or national letters such as “á”, “ö”) leads to application-log error EDOCUMENT_MM 009 “Special characters not allowed for Reference number of customs form” and the XML/PDF is not rendered.\n\nWhy the error appears in your case  \n1. The PO header text field was left empty, therefore the enhancement logic reads the next available text line (MIGO header).  \n2. That text contains at least one character that is not in the allowed whitelist.  \n3. The mapping class rejects the value and raises the message; the outbound process is therefore stopped.\n\nHow to solve  \n\nOption A – Master data / process fix (recommended)  \n1. Maintain the correct Customs Reference in the PO header text type IMPORT_TEXT_TYPE (transaction ME22N → Header → Texts) and ensure it contains only letters, digits, hyphen, slash, dot or blank, max 35 chars, e.g.  \n “2306-ABCD-987654”  \n2. Remove any emojis, accents, “&” or similar from MIGO header texts so that even the fallback value is compliant.  \n3. Re-submit the invoice; XML and PDF will be created.\n\nOption B – Code fix (if the text cannot be cleaned)  \nEnhance your BAdI implementation and add a sanitation step before passing the value back to DRC:\n\n```\nDATA(lv_raw) = lt_text_lines[ 1 ]-tdline.\nDATA(lv_clean) = cl_abap_string_utilities=>replace_all(\n                   val = lv_raw\n                   sub = '[^A-Z0-9\\\\-\\\\./_ ]'\n                   with = ''   \"remove\n                   occ = cl_abap_regex=>all ).\nev_customs_ref = lv_clean(35).   \"truncate to 35\n```\n\nor simply call the SAP helper method (exists in most SP levels):\n\n```\nev_customs_ref = cl_edocument_util=>sanitize_doc_number( iv_value = lv_raw ).\n```\n\nOption C – Bypass check (NOT advised)  \nYou could switch message EDOCUMENT_MM 009 from “E” to “W” via transaction SE91, but this would produce non-compliant XML, so authorities or Peppol access points would reject it.\n\nChecklist of allowed characters  \nA B C … Z (uppercase only)  \n0 - 9  \nHyphen “-”, Slash “/”, Dot “.”, Underscore “_”, Blank\n\nCustomizing path for the text type used  \nSPRO → Materials Management → Purchasing → Purchase Order → Texts → Define Text Types for Header / Item.  \nConfirm that IMPORT_TEXT_TYPE is active for header level.\n\nPlain-language summary  \nThe e-invoice fails because the system copies a header text that contains illegal symbols into the “Customs Form Reference” field; keep that text to simple letters/numbers (max 35 chars) or cleanse it in your enhancement, then resubmit the invoice.",

         "Technical explanation\n• The two cockpit URLs you provided are Neo-environment subaccounts that lie under global account 38669bd2-…​.  \n• Uploading a “P9Q” (Peppol SMP Q-warrant) client-certificate requires the ­Subaccount Administrator or ­Security Administrator role in that Neo subaccount, not merely the role inside the Peppol Cloud application.  \n• Those roles can only be assigned by an existing Global-Account Administrator or by someone who already holds Subaccount-Admin on the same subaccount.  \n• In Neo the role assignment is performed in the cockpit, not in the Peppol Cloud dashboard, therefore your present application-level access is insufficient.\n\nHow to obtain the required access\n1. Identify a person who is already Global Account Admin for 38669bd2-43c3-485c-b1f3-60a369ed4ce8 (often the basis or infrastructure team that created the Neo account).  \n2. Ask that person to do ONE of the following for each subaccount (8c0dcfe8-… and 8dc60f96-…):\n   a. Add your S-user or e-mail to the “Subaccount Administrator” cockpit role collection.  \n   ‑ Cockpit → Global Account → Security → Administrators → “Add” → choose user → assign “Subaccount Administrator”.  \n   OR  \n   b. Grant you “Security Administrator” which is sufficient for certificate/key store operations.  \n3. After the role is saved, log out/in once; you will now see the “Security” tile inside the subaccount cockpit.  \n4. Navigate: Subaccount → Security → Certificates & Keys → “Upload” → select the P9Q *.p12 or *.pfx file → enter the private-key password → Save.  \n5. Restart the Peppol Cloud Java/XS app (if required by your vendor guide) so that the runtime picks up the new certificate.\n\nIf no Global Account admin is known, raise a ticket with SAP BTP operations (component BC-NEO-CIS) quoting the global-account GUID and explicitly requesting that your user be made Subaccount Administrator; SAP will ask for authorisation from the commercial contact before acting.\n\nPlain-language summary\nYou don’t yet have the right cockpit role; ask an existing global-account or subaccount admin to add your user as “Subaccount Administrator” (or “Security Administrator”) in those two Neo subaccounts, then you can upload the P9Q certificate yourself.",

         "Technical explanation  \n• The inbound-document part of SAP Document & Reporting Compliance (the “eDocument Cockpit”) only recognises one viewer action at run-time: DISPLAY_HTML, hard–coded in class CL_EDOC_DCC_ACTION_WEBUI→DISPLAY_HTML.  \n• For DISPLAY_PDF the framework looks for a secondary action of the same name; the code is delivered (method DISPLAY_PDF in the same class), but that action is never entered in the standard configuration for inbound document types.  \n• Because the toolbar is generated from table EDOCACTION / view V_EDOCACTION, and because inbound types such as INV_IN (ZUGFeRD) are shipped without a line for action DISPLAY_PDF, no “PDF” button is rendered in the cockpit—even if a file with file_type = ‘PDF’ (or ‘PDF_PREVW’) is present in EDOCUMENTFILE.  \n• The PUSH-interface therefore allows you to attach the PDF, but the standard UI gives no way to call the display routine.  \n\nWhat you can do  \n1. Customising (no coding)  \n   • SPRO → Financial Accounting → General Ledger → Periodic Processing → eDocument Framework → Define eDocument Actions (table EDOCACTION)  \n   • Add a new entry for your inbound eDocument type:  \n     – Action  : DISPLAY_PDF  \n     – Class/Method: CL_EDOC_DCC_ACTION_WEBUI → DISPLAY_PDF  \n     – UI profile : the one you use for the cockpit (usually DC_INBOUND)  \n   • Transport the change.  \n   • Next time you open the cockpit a “PDF” button (or overflow-menu entry) appears; pressing it calls the delivered method and opens the pushed-in PDF with function EFG_DISPLAY_PDF.\n\n2. If you want a different label or further checks, copy CL_EDOC_DCC_ACTION_WEBUI into your own Z-class, register that in EDOCACTION instead of the SAP class, and adapt as necessary.\n\n3. No SAP-standard option exists to show the PDF without such a custom action; storing it alone is not enough.\n\nPlain-language summary  \nSAP ships inbound eDocument cockpit with an HTML-viewer only; to view the original ZUGFeRD PDF you must add a DISPLAY_PDF action in the eDocument-action customizing (or create your own), after which a new “PDF” button will open the file you already attach to the PUSH-service.",

         "Technical explanation\n• What kind of certificate is required?  \n  – A standard X.509 client-authentication certificate (public key).  \n  – It is used by the Peppol Exchange iFlows (running on SAP Integration Suite) when they call the S/4HANA Cloud APIs that belong to your “Communication User”.  \n  – Only the public certificate is uploaded in S/4HANA Cloud; the private key stays in the Integration Suite keystore.\n\n• Where do you get it? – two supported options  \n\n  1. “Create certificate in S/4HANA Cloud”  \n     a. In the app Communication Systems choose ➡ Actions ➡ Create Certificate.  \n     b. The system generates a self-signed client certificate and immediately stores its public part.  \n     c. Download the *.p12 file that contains the certificate + private key.  \n     d. Import that *.p12 into the SAP Integration Suite keystore (or a CPI keystore entry) and reference it in your Peppol Exchange iflows.  \n     e. In Maintain Communication Users select the user, press Add Certificate, and pick the certificate that was just generated for the communication system.  \n     – Advantage: one-click, nothing to request from a CA.  \n   \n  2. “Bring-your-own certificate” (e.g. generated with OpenSSL or directly in Integration Suite)  \n     a. Create a key pair in Integration Suite → Monitor → Keystore → Add → Generate Key Pair (or use OpenSSL).  \n     b. Export the public certificate as Base-64/PEM (.cer/.crt).  \n     c. In S/4HANA Cloud → Maintain Communication Users → the user → Add Certificate → upload that .cer/.crt file.  \n     d. The corresponding private key already sits in the Integration Suite keystore, so the iflows can present it.\n\n• Accepted file format when you upload in S/4:  \n  – Base-64 encoded X.509 certificate (text file starting with “-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----”).  \n  – File extensions .cer or .crt; DER-encoded binary is also possible but PEM is recommended.  \n  – Do NOT upload a .p12/.pfx; only the public certificate.\n\n• Why you cannot use Basic Auth here: Peppol Exchange content package is hard-wired for client-certificate authentication because some Peppol Service Providers and Access Points require mutual TLS.\n\nQuick step-by-step (variant 1 – easiest)  \n1. Apps → Communication Systems → New / select existing → Actions → Create Certificate → Download.  \n2. Apps → Maintain Communication Users → New / select existing → Add Certificate → choose the certificate created in step 1.  \n3. Integration Suite → Monitor → Keystore → Add Entry → Upload the downloaded .p12 → give it an alias (e.g. PEPPOL_S4).  \n4. Open each Peppol Exchange iFlow → Runtime Configuration → set “Client Certificate Alias” to PEPPOL_S4.  \n5. Deploy iFlows – they now connect to S/4HANA Cloud with certificate-based authentication.\n\nPlain-language summary\nYou don’t “get” the certificate from SAP; you generate your own X.509 client certificate (either automatically inside S/4HANA Cloud or in Integration Suite), upload only its public part to the Communication User, and keep the private key in Integration Suite so that the Peppol Exchange iFlows can log on securely.",

Both RETRIEVE_TOKEN_CC and RETRIEVE_TOKEN_HTTP raise CX_NFE_CLOUD_SERVICE_COMM when  \n   • the destination name in MS_CLOUD_CONFIGURATION-OAUTH2 cannot be found, or  \n   • the OAuth-server returns an error / invalid credentials, or  \n   • the trust SSL handshake fails.  \n   (See explicit RAISE EXCEPTION statements in both methods.)\n\n3. The same login logic is executed when you run the connectivity test in SOAMANAGER; therefore the identical failure (“login to cloud not possible”) appears in both EDOC_COCKPIT and the WS-test.\n\nWhat to check / fix\n\nA. Cloud configuration table  \n   EDOC_BR → “Communication Scenario” maintenance (transaction EDOC_CLOUD_CONF or view NFCLOUDCONFTMP).  \n   • FIELD OAUTH2 must contain the exact SM59 destination (type G, SSL active).  \n   • ACTION “PROTOCOL” should be flagged as VALID.\n\nB. SM59 destination used for OAuth2  \n   • Connection type G, “SSL certificate” tab: server certificate of the SAP Document & Reporting Compliance tenant must be in the client PSE.  \n   • “OAuth 2.0 Settings”:  \n        – Grant type  = Client Credentials  \n        – Token Service URL = …/oauth/token  \n        – Client ID / Client Secret copied from BTP subaccount’s service key  \n        – Authentication = “Client ID and Secret in Header” (unless your landscape requires url-encoded body).  \n   Test the destination in SM59; status code must be 200 and you should receive a JSON with “access_token”.\n\nC. OA2C profile (if you use the OA2C transaction instead of SM59)  \n   • Transaction OA2C_CONFIG: profile ID that matches MS_CLOUD_CONFIGURATION-OAUTH2.  \n   • Make sure user = “DEFAULT” and client credentials are stored.  \n   • Assign the profile to a communication arrangement if required.\n\nD. Trust store  \n   A 403 or SSL error in SM59 indicates the root certificate of the BTP endpoint is missing. Import the *.peppol.cloud.sap root/intermediate certificates into the STRUST SSL-client (Anonymous) PSE and restart ICM.\n\nE. SOAMANAGER logical port  \n   • In Logon & Security set “WSIL | OAuth 2.0” and reference the same SM59 destination or OA2C profile.  \n   • Re-test; the SOAP test message should now add a valid Authorization: Bearer header.\n\nF. Typical error patterns & fixes  \n   • 401 “unauthorized” → wrong client-secret or scope. Create a new service key in BTP, update SM59/OA2C.  \n   • 403 “forbidden” → user not authorised for the business service. Check the BTP role collections (“SAP_BR_EDOC_*_SENDER”) and assign to the service instance.  \n   • ICM_SSL-xxx in dev_icm → import missing root certificate.\n\nQuick self-check\n\n1. Transaction EDOC_CONFIG_TEST → Connectivity Check  \n2. SM59 destination test → HTTP 200 + JSON access_token  \n3. EDOC_COCKPIT → resend. Status should progress to “SENT”.\n\nPlain-language summary  \nThe backend cannot reach the cloud service because the OAuth2 destination (client ID/secret, SSL trust) is not set up correctly. Fix the SM59/OA2C destination referenced in the eDocument cloud configuration, import the correct SSL certificates, and the login will succeed in both EDOC_COCKPIT and SOAMANAGER.",

         "Technical explanation  \nWhen an eDocument is generated from a Settlement-Management (SM) document the SAP framework runs the following checks in the delivered ABAP classes:\n\n• CL_IM_EDOC_STLMT → IF_EDOC_STLMT~CREATE_EDOCUMENT  \n 1. go_edoc_config_db->SELECT_EDOCOMPANYACTIV( iv_source_type = CL_EDOC_SOURCE_STLMT=>GC_SRC_STLMT_INV ).  \n  → Entry must exist and be flagged Active for every company code that shall create an eDocument.  \n 2. CL_EDOC_SOURCE_STLMT builds the source payload and hands it over to CL_EDOC_MAP_CII for France-specific mapping (“fill_settlement”).  \n• CL_EDOC_SOURCE_STLMT~DETERMINE_EDOC_TYPE reads table EDOTMFK (go_edoc_config_db->SELECT_EDOTMFK) with keys Country = ‘FR’ and LFART (SM document type).  \n → The LFART must therefore be assigned to an eDocument type (for example FR_CII_INV / FR_CII_CRN).\n\nIf one of those two Customizing checks fails the method returns without creating the eDocument, therefore the process has to be enabled in Customizing – not in code.\n\nSteps to enable the new source type “Settlement Management Documents” for France e-Invoicing\n\n1. Software prerequisite  \n   • Apply the support package or SAP Notes that deliver the new source type and mapping classes (starting with SAP Note 3309831 and its prerequisites, or the corresponding SP in OP 2023/CE 2308 and higher).  \n   • Run SNOTE and SRTQC to make sure all objects (CL_EDOC_SOURCE_STLMT, CL_EDOC_MAP_CII enhancement, etc.) are present and active.\n\n2. Define/verify the source type (delivered automatically)  \n   IMG → SAP Document and Reporting Compliance → eDocument Framework → Source Types → Define Source Types  \n   • Check that source type code “STLMT_INV” (text: “Settlement Management Documents”) exists and points to class CL_EDOC_SOURCE_STLMT.  \n   (Delivered by SAP; do not change anything.)\n\n3. Activate the source type per company code  \n   IMG → … → Activate eDocument for Company Code  \n   • Insert a new line for every French company code.  \n     Company Code = XXXX  \n     Source Type = STLMT_INV (Settlement Management Documents)  \n     Active  = ☑  \n\n   This fulfils the SELECT_EDOCOMPANYACTIV check in class CL_IM_EDOC_STLMT.\n\n4. Assign SM document types to an eDocument type  \n   IMG → SAP Document and Reporting Compliance → eInvoice France → Define eDocument Types (view V_EDOTMFK)  \n   • For country FR maintain at least the SM document types you use (field LFART, e.g. ‘Z1’, ‘Z2’).  \n   • Map them to the correct eDocument type, for example:  \n       FR Z1 → FR_CII_INV (Invoice)  \n       FR Z2 → FR_CII_CRN (Credit note)  \n   • Maintain number-range object and logical receiver if they are still initial.  \n   This fulfils the SELECT_EDOTMFK check in CL_EDOC_SOURCE_STLMT.\n\n5. (Optional) Maintain value mappings used in class CL_EDOC_MAP_CII  \n   IMG → eDocument Framework → Define Value Mappings  \n   • If your SM documents use special payment terms, tax exemptions, etc., add external value ↔ internal value pairs so that “fill_settlement” can translate them into the CII structures.\n\n6. (Optional) Enhance the mapping  \n   If standard CII/UBL mapping is not sufficient, implement BAdI EDOC_FR_MAP_CII (or the generic BAdI EDOC_MAP_ENHANCE) to add or overwrite fields after SAP’s mapping class has run.\n\n7. Test  \n   • Create an SM document (WB**N).  \n   • Save – an entry should be written to EDOCUMENT table automatically.  \n   • Open transaction EDOC_COCKPIT (or Fiori app “Monitor eDocuments”) → check that the document with source type “STLMT_INV” and eDocument type FR_CII_INV/CRN is in status “Created”.  \n   • Trigger the next process step (XML generation, Peppol submission, etc.) and verify the fields that come from method CL_EDOC_MAP_CII=>FILL_SETTLEMENT.\n\nPlain-language summary  \nInstall the latest SAP note/SP, switch on the new source type “Settlement Management Documents” for each French company code, and map your SM document types to a French e-Invoice eDocument type in Customizing; after that every new Settlement-Management document will automatically create an eDocument with the enhanced France mapping.",

         "Technical explanation (what you must switch on and where the mapping logic sits)\n\n1. Activate the “Settlement-Management invoice” source type for the Company Code  \n   • SPRO → Financial Accounting → Country-Specific Functions → Electronic Document → Activate eDocument for Company Code  \n   • Table EDOCOMPANYACTIV (direct maintenance) – create a line with  \n     – BUKRS = your company code  \n     – SOURCE_TYPE = ST-LMT_INV (constant CL_EDOC_SOURCE_STLMT=>GC_SRC_STLMT_INV)  \n     – ACTIVE   = “X”\n\n   The framework method GO_EDOC_CONFIG_DB->SELECT_EDOCOMPANYACTIV (see class CL_IM_EDOC_STLMT, method IF_EDOC_STLMT~CREATE_EDOCUMENT) checks exactly this flag before it processes a settlement document.\n\n2. Generate an eDocument when a Settlement document (WBRK/ KOML*) is posted  \n   • Implement or activate the delivered BAdI “EDOC_STLMT” (Interface IF_EDOC_STLMT).  \n   • SAP ships a ready-to-use class CL_IM_EDOC_STLMT. Its method IF_EDOC_STLMT~CREATE_EDOCUMENT reads KOMLFK/ KOMLFP/ KOMWBPA/ KOMV and calls\n\n         CL_EDOC_SOURCE_STLMT=>SET_DATA_FROM_STLMT( )\n         …->PREPARE_EDOCUMENTS( )              \"creates the eDocument runtime instance\n\n3. Make the factory recognise a French document  \n   • No work here – CL_EDOC_FACTORY_FR->CREATE_EDOC_INSTANCES already instantiates CL_EDOCUMENT_EU_FR when the document country (T001-LAND1) returns ‘FR’.\n\n4. Mapping from “Settlement-Invoice” source to the France ChorusPro target structure  \n   a) Source side  \n      Method: CL_EDOC_SOURCE_STLMT=>SET_DATA_FROM_STLMT  \n      • fills structure EDOC_SRC_DATA_STLMT_INVOICE with KOMLFK, KOMLFP, KOMWBPA, KOMV, BKPF/BSEG/BSET …  \n      • sets SOURCE_HEADER-SOURCE_TYPE = ‘STLMT_INV’ (constant shown in tool output)  \n\n   b) Country-specific mapping (France)  \n      Method: CL_EDOC_MAP_FR_B2B->GET_MAPPING_SOURCE_DATA  \n      (tool output lines “WHEN 'STLMT_INV'. …”)  \n      • copies the fields coming from SET_DATA_FROM_STLMT into the generic France mapping source EDOC_FR_INV_MAPPING_SOURCE.  \n      • therefore any later France-specific field logic (tax, SIRET, etc.) that already exists for SD or FI is reused.\n\n   c) ChorusPro UBL 2.1 specific mapping  \n      • CL_EDOC_MAP_UBL_STLMT->GET_SOURCE_DOCUMENT_DATA_STLMT – converts the same source data into the generic UBL mapping structure.  \n      • CL_EDOC_MAP_CO_STLMT_UBL_21 (inherits from CL_EDOC_MAP_CO_SD_UBL_21) – contains dedicated “map_*” methods such as MAP_ATTACHDOC1 that add settlement-specific elements (parentDocumentID, etc.) to the Chorus request.\n\n   In other words, no additional customer code is required unless you need extra fields. If so, inherit from CL_EDOC_MAP_FR_B2B or CL_EDOC_MAP_CO_STLMT_UBL_21 and redefine the relevant MAP_* methods.\n\n5. Process determination (which FR process is chosen)  \n   • CL_EDOCUMENT_FR_INV->DETERMINE_PROCESS already contains a WHEN branch for CL_EDOC_SOURCE_STLMT=>GC_SRC_STLMT_INV and sets the proper process (e.g. FRB2BCINV or FRB2BSBINV) depending on KOART and BP status.\n\nSummary steps\n\n1. Activate eDocument for company code & source type ‘STLMT_INV’.  \n2. Activate BAdI EDOC_STLMT (or keep SAP’s implementation CL_IM_EDOC_STLMT) – it calls SET_DATA_FROM_STLMT.  \n3. No extra factory work – CL_EDOC_FACTORY_FR handles France.  \n4. Mapping happens in standard SAP classes:  \n   • Source acquisition: CL_EDOC_SOURCE_STLMT=>SET_DATA_FROM_STLMT  \n   • Country mapping: CL_EDOC_MAP_FR_B2B->GET_MAPPING_SOURCE_DATA (WHEN 'STLMT_INV')  \n   • Chorus UBL 2.1 mapping: CL_EDOC_MAP_UBL_STLMT->GET_SOURCE_DOCUMENT_DATA_STLMT + CL_EDOC_MAP_CO_STLMT_UBL_21->MAP_*  \n\nIf you need to enhance the XML further, subclass CL_EDOC_MAP_CO_STLMT_UBL_21 and redefine the required MAP_* methods; register the subclass in view EDOC_CUST_MAP.\n\nPlain-language takeaway: switch on “STLMT_INV” in the eDocument settings, let SAP’s standard BAdI create the eDocument, and the delivered mapping classes already translate Settlement Management invoices into the French ChorusPro electronic-invoice format.",

Make sure the line with cl_edoc_source_stlmt=>gc_src_stlmt_inv is present (or add it exactly as above).  \n2. Re-activate the class; afterwards Settlement-Management billing documents will be regarded as relevant, eDocuments will be generated and the mapping step can be enhanced in the usual way (BAdI EDOCUMENT_FR_MAP, custom adaptor, etc.).\n\nPlain-language summary  \nA single additional line in method IS_RELEVANT of CL_EDOCUMENT_FR_INV authorises source type “Settlement Management Invoice”; once that line is in place the France eDocument run will pick up Settlement-Management documents automatically.",
