         "Technical explanation (what you actually do)  \n1. Identify the gap  \n   – Download the XML created for a test eDocument in the Fiori-tile “Manage Electronic Documents”.  \n   – Decide whether data are missing (new node/attribute) or wrong (value needs correcting).\n\n2. Prefer “configuration-only” enrichment – no coding  \n   a. Open SSCUI 104197 “Define Mapping for XML Fields”.  \n      • Copy SAP’s delivered variant (GR_EBOOKS_STD) to your own Z-variant.  \n      • Add new lines that map an SAP field, fixed value or CDS-derived field to the exact path in the myDATA schema.  \n   b. If the value must be translated, maintain it in SSCUI 104198 “Maintain Value Mappings”.  \n   Result: at runtime AIF reads your mapping tables and the XML leaves the tenant already enriched.\n\n3. When logic is required, use the cloud BAdI – implemented in ADT  \n   a. In Eclipse ADT (or Fiori “Custom Logic” if you prefer the web editor) create an “ABAP Cloud Project” for your tenant.  \n   b. Create a new enhancement implementation:  \n      • Business Context: eDocument: Greece (EDO_GREECE)  \n      • BAdI: Cloud EDOC Adaptor BADI: Modify Final Invoice XML.  \n   c. Sample skeleton:  \n      ```\n      METHOD if_edm_gr_modify_xml~modify_xml.\n        DATA(lv_xml) = cl_abap_codepage=>convert_from( io_xml ).  \"xstr→str\n        \"…parse / modify with cl_sxml_string_reader…\n        io_xml = cl_abap_codepage=>convert_to( lv_xml ).        \"str→xstr\n      ENDMETHOD.\n      ```  \n   d. Optional validation: build an error message in the CT_MESSAGES table and raise CX_EDM_BADI_ABORT to stop submission.  \n   e. Activate and add the object to a software collection for transport.\n\n4. Make extra application data available (if needed)  \n   – Create a custom field in Key-User Extensibility (or a custom CDS view).  \n   – Expose the field so that it is visible either in the mapping SSCUI or in your BAdI code.\n\n5. Transport & test  \n   – Export your software collection; import in the test tenant.  \n   – Re-submit an eDocument, open AIF Interface Monitor: the XML shown there must contain the new/changed element.  \n   – Continue the flow; CPI iFlow and AADE web-service should now receive the enriched payload.\n\n6. Monitor in production  \n   – Tile “Application Log” (object EDOCUMENT_GR, subobject XML_MAPPING) shows mapping and BAdI errors.  \n   – eDocument Cockpit status “Rejected by BAdI” pinpoints validation failures coming from your code.\n\nKey sequence of SAP components  \nBilling/Journal → eDocument (EDOCUMENT) → AIF mapping tables (your SSCUIs) → OPTIONAL BAdI in ADT → XML stored in EDOC_XML → CPI iFlow → AADE myDATA.\n\nPlain-language summary  \n“In S/4HANA Public Cloud for Greece you never touch SAP standard code.  \nYou enrich the myDATA XML either by (1) simply mapping extra fields or value conversions in two SSCUIs, or, if real logic is needed, by (2) creating a small cloud BAdI in ADT that edits the finished XML before it is sent.  \nBoth options are upgrade-safe and take effect automatically every time an invoice is transmitted to the Greek tax authority.”",

         "Technical answer  \nYes. In SAP S/4HANA Cloud, public edition you are allowed to post-process the Greece e-invoice XML that the Document & Reporting Compliance (eDocument) framework creates, directly before the file is handed over to SAP Cloud Integration / the myDATA web-service.  \nThe supported enhancement point is:\n\n• BAdI definition EDOC_ADAPTOR_CLOUD (enhancement spot ES_EDOCUMENT_CLOUD)  \n  – Exposed in the key-user “Custom Logic” app as:  \n    “Cloud EDOC Adaptor BADI: Modify final invoice XML”  \n  – Filter values such as GR_INV_OUT, GR_CNOTE, GR_DELNOTE … let you target only the Greek customer-invoice flow.\n\nWhen this BAdI is implemented the framework sequence is:\n\n1. SD/FI invoice is saved → eDocument is created.  \n2. Standard AIF mapping builds the XML.  \n3. Method MODIFY_FINAL_XML of your BAdI implementation is called.  \n   • Imports: document context and an iXML DOM reference.  \n   • Changing: ct_xml_string – the raw XML string table.  \n4. Your code can add, change, or delete nodes/attributes (e.g. set custom VAT classification, add QR-code URL, correct expense category).  \n5. The amended XML is then submitted to the tax authority.\n\nImplementation variants\n\nKey-user (in-app):  \n• App “Custom Logic” → Business Context “eDocument: Greece” → choose the adaptor BAdI → write ABAP Cloud code.  \nDeveloper extensibility:  \n• ADT/Eclipse → create class ZCL_EDOC_ADAPT_GR implementing IF_EDOC_ADAPTOR_CLOUD.  \n• (Optionally) steer the execution with method CHANGE_ADAPTOR_GENERIC_FILTER in a source-process class.\n\nConstraints / good practice\n\n• You must NOT change the structure beyond the published XSD – the file must still validate against the myDATA schema.  \n• Heavy logic should be filter-driven to avoid multiple implementations.  \n• Test via Fiori/GUI app EDOC_COCKPIT: create invoice → action “Submit” → inspect the log/XML, correct, then “Resubmit”.  \n• If only simple field content must be set, first consider the delivered Value Mapping SSCUI; use the BAdI only when mapping is insufficient.\n\nPlain-language summary  \nIn the Greek e-invoicing process you can indeed tweak the XML that leaves SAP S/4HANA Cloud: implement the “EDOC_ADAPTOR_CLOUD” BAdI (available in the Custom Logic app) and change the XML right before it is sent to the tax authority.",

         "Technical answer  \nYes. In SAP S/4HANA Cloud, public edition (Spain), you can extend the delivered “Spain ­– Customer Invoice” eDocument scenario, but only with the in-app (“key-user”) extensibility options that SAP has whitelisted for Public Cloud. According to the official SAP Help pages:\n\n1. Available enhancement points  \n   • Four Business Add-Ins (BAdIs) can be implemented in the Custom Logic app (Business context eDocument: Spain):  \n     – Fill Bank Account Data (IBAN)  \n     – Fill Delivery-Note Field  \n     – Fill Discounts and Charges Reason  \n     – Determine Reason Code for correction invoices  \n   These BAdIs are called during XML generation; you write ABAP code in the generated class stub and transport it via standard Cloud TM.\n\n2. Custom fields / authorisations  \n   • The Custom Fields & Logic app lets you add fields (e.g. sales org) to the eDocument header/table EDOC_DOCUMENT and expose them in the eDocument Cockpit UI and CDS views.  \n   • The same fields can be used in catalogue roles to restrict what each user sees.\n\n3. What you cannot do in Public Cloud  \n   • Change SAP-delivered XML structure, namespace or schema.  \n   • Modify the core posting logic of billing/FI or the SAP Document Compliance framework.  \n   • Install classic user-exits or Z-reports in the cloud tenant.\n\n4. Side-by-side options  \n   • If functional gaps remain, you can build side-by-side services on SAP BTP (e.g. CAP application) and call the public eDocument APIs, but you still leave the standard Spain process intact.\n\nExample snippet (Custom Logic – Fill Delivery-Note Field)  \n\n```\nMETHOD if_edoc_es_delnote~calculate_delivery_note.\n  DATA lv_delvno TYPE vbuk-vbeln.\n  SELECT SINGLE vbelv INTO lv_delvno\n         FROM vbfa\n         WHERE vbelv = @is_source_document-billingdoc.\n  cs_edoc_invoice-delivery_note = lv_delvno.\nENDMETHOD.\n```\n\nPlain-language summary  \nYes—you can adapt Spain’s customer-invoice eInvoicing flow in S/4HANA Public Cloud, but only through the key-user BAdIs and custom-field framework that SAP explicitly allows; core program changes are not permitted.",

SAP makes the eDocument framework extensible via released Cloud BAdIs (Enhancement Spot ES_EDOCUMENT_CLOUD).  \n   • In ADT you create an Enhancement Implementation and implement the BAdI that fits your need (for Italy invoices typically EDOC_ADAPTOR_CLOUD or a country-specific one such as EDOC_IT_XML_FILE/ EDOC_IT_XML_CUST).  \n   • Exit methods let you adjust data BEFORE_MAPPING, AFTER_MAPPING, BEFORE_SUBMIT, AFTER_RECEIVE, etc.  \n2. Prerequisites  \n   • 3-system landscape with Developer Extensibility (ABAP Cloud) enabled.  \n   • License for SAP Document and Reporting Compliance and a subscription to SAP Integration Suite (runtime to send/receive XML to SdI).  \n3. Steps to extend  \n   a. Identify the BAdI in ADT and create an implementation in your customer namespace.  \n   b. Add filter values (Process Type = ‘IT_INVOICE’) so the logic runs only for Italian customer invoices.  \n   c. Code your changes (e.g. add CUP/CIG nodes, change routing parameters, enrich header text).  \n   d. Activate, transport to Q-system, test in “Manage Electronic Documents” (Fiori F2547) or “eDocument Cockpit” (F2548).  \n   e. No IMG configuration changes are needed; enablement is purely via the BAdI implementation.  \n4. Other supported extension points  \n   • Custom Fields & Logic app – add YY1_* fields to header/items and expose them to the cockpit.  \n   • EDOC_PART_CONN_CHANGE_EMAIL_V2 – if you also want to adapt the email a customer receives after the XML is sent.  \n\nTool evidence  \n• SAP Help page “Extending an Existing Process – Extensibility for Electronic Document Processing” (help.sap.com → S/4HANA Cloud public) explicitly describes creating a Cloud BAdI implementation to modify an electronic document process.  \n• SAP documentation summary on “Electronic Document Processing Framework” confirms that developer extensibility and BAdIs are the way to “extend existing processes for customer invoices in Italy”.\n\nPlain-language takeaway  \nYou can indeed tweak the Italian e-invoice flow in the public cloud—SAP provides official enhancement exits that let you inject custom ABAP logic without touching standard code.",

Configure the process  \n   • Fiori app “Document Compliance Framework Development → Manage eDocument Process”  \n   • Copy an SAP reference (e.g. TR_TR_EINV) or start from scratch and save your own process ID.  \n   • Map technical status codes to the business statuses you want to show in the cockpit (table EDOMETASTATUS1V).\n\n2.

Show the XML that belongs to your process  \n   Implement BAdI EDOCUMENT_INT_CONN_EXT (method GET_EDOCUMENT) to read your own tables, build the UBL-TR XML and return it so that cockpit users can choose “Display XML”.\n\n4. Jobs & communication  \n   As soon as the custom process is registered, its job template appears in “Schedule eDocument Jobs” so you can plan Submit / Status Query jobs that reuse the standard Turkey iFlows.\n\n5. Test in the cockpit apps  \n   “eDocument Cockpit” and “Manage Electronic Documents” immediately list records of the new process.  \n   Your implementations are executed when users press Cancel, Delete, or Display XML.\n\nSources (tool output)  \n• SAP Help summary on Turkey DRC extensibility – describes the Manage eDocument Process app, status mapping table EDOMETASTATUS1V, interface IF_EDOCUMENT_EXT_ES, class CL_EDOCUMENT_EXT_ES and BAdI EDOCUMENT_INT_CONN_EXT.  \n• SAP documentation summary confirms developer extensibility for custom eDocument processes in the public cloud and points to ADT in the 3-system landscape.\n\nPlain-language one-liner  \nYes—you can create your own Turkey eDocument process in S/4HANA Cloud, public edition and plug in custom ABAP logic to control or add cockpit actions such as Cancel, Delete, or Display XML.",

         "Yes. In SAP S/4HANA Cloud, public edition, you can create or replace an Action in the eDocument Cockpit for a custom-developed electronic-document process.\n\nTechnical explanation  \n1. Prerequisites  \n   • Business catalog SAP_SD_BC_GLO_EDOC_PC assigned to the developer.  \n   • Developer extensibility (ABAP Cloud) enabled in the tenant.\n\n2. Where the action is defined  \n   • In SSCUI “Process Definitions for Electronic Documents” (Configuration Environment or CBC).  \n   • Each line of the action list links an “Action Key” (e.g. SUBMIT, ZRESUBMIT) to  \n     – Source status → Target status  \n     – An ABAP class that implements interface IF_EDOCUMENT_ACTION.\n\n3. How to add / extend an action  \n   Step 1 – Copy the delivered process or create a new one, then add your Z-action in the action list.  \n   Step 2 – In ADT (ABAP Cloud project) create class ZCL_EDOC_<ACTION> and implement method IF_EDOCUMENT_ACTION~EXECUTE. Typical pattern:  \n      SELECT header FROM EDOCUMENT …  \n      Build/validate XML using CL_EDOC_XML_HELPER  \n      Call external REST/SOAP service with HTTP Client API  \n      Persist attachments in EDOC_FILE (role ‘SUBMITTED_XML’ etc.)  \n      Set the new status with CL_EDOC_STATUS_MGR=>SET_STATUS( ).  \n   Step 3 – Transport the configuration (CBC) and the class to P, then run “Deploy Configuration”.  \n   Step 4 – Expose it in the UI via Fiori app “App Extensibility – eDocument Cockpit” → Adapt Actions → map UI button to the backend Action Key.  \n   Optional: schedule the new action periodically in “Schedule eDocument Jobs”.\n\n4. What you CANNOT do  \n   • You cannot modify SAP-delivered classes in public cloud; you must copy the process and plug in your own class.  \n   • You cannot bypass the status-schema check—each action must have a valid source and target status maintained in the process definition.  \n\nIllustrative snippet (ABAP Cloud)  \n\nCLASS zcl_edoc_resubmit DEFINITION  \n  PUBLIC CREATE PUBLIC.  \n  PUBLIC SECTION.  \n    INTERFACES if_edocument_action.  \nENDCLASS.  \n\nCLASS zcl_edoc_resubmit IMPLEMENTATION.  \n  METHOD if_edocument_action~execute.  \n    DATA(lo_edoc) = cl_edoc_facade=>get( iv_edoc_id ).  \n    lo_edoc->prepare_payload( ).                \"build XML  \n    lo_edoc->call_service( ).                   \"HTTP POST  \n    cl_edoc_status_mgr=>set_status( lo_edoc->id  \n                                    iv_new_status = 'ZSENT' ).  \n  ENDMETHOD.  \nENDCLASS.  \n\nPlain-language answer  \nYes—you can add your own action by copying the eDocument process, creating an ABAP Cloud class that implements IF_EDOCUMENT_ACTION, assigning it to the new action in SSCUI “Process Definitions for Electronic Documents”, and exposing it in the Fiori cockpit.",

Create the action key  \n   • SPRO → Cross-Application Components → eDocument → Maintain Actions  \n   • Add a new line with a Z* action code (e.g. “ZPOST_TO_PORTAL”).  \n   • Assign it to “BAdI Implementation” as the Execution Type.\n\n2. Implement the action logic  \n   • SE18 → Enhancement Spot EDOCUMENT → BAdI EDOC_ACTION_HANDLER (or country-specific BAdI if one exists).  \n   • In method EXECUTE_ACTION code the steps you want (call your process manager variant, RFC to partner, REST call, status update, etc.).  \n   • Use method SET_ADDITIONAL_DATA or the EXPORTING parameters to hand back new cockpit status texts, AIF log keys, etc.\n\n3. (Optional) Add custom fields the action might need  \n   • Fiori app “Custom Fields & Logic” → create fields on the I_EDOC* CDS view extension.  \n   • Populate them with BAdI EDOC_CUSTOM_FIELDS_CLOUD → FILL_EDOC_CUSTOM_FIELDS.\n\n4. Authorisations  \n   • If you created new cockpit fields, the Custom Fields tool generates matching authorisation objects; add them to your roles in PFCG.\n\nTechnical recipe (front-end)\n\n5. Expose the button  \n   • Launch the eDocument Cockpit Fiori app in Adapt UI.  \n   • Insert a new toolbar button, bind it to your Z* action key (value help shows all keys from step 1).  \n   • Save as a key-user extension or ship an SAPUI5 extension project if you need advanced behaviour.\n\nResulting behaviour\n\n• The new button appears only for documents whose country/solution allows the action (based on your SPRO entry).  \n• When the user clicks it, the cockpit calls your BAdI code, updates the document status, and logs the result in AIF (transaction /AIF/ERR).  \n• Works for any document type (billing, FI, MM, …) because the cockpit is framework-agnostic.\n\nLimits & remarks for Private Cloud\n\n• All above steps are available in Private Cloud; only the “Custom Code in ABAP Cloud Environment” rules apply (stay inside customer namespace Z* or Y*).  \n• No direct modification of SAP-delivered CDS views—always use CDS view extension.  \n• Transport the BAdI implementation and UI adaptation through your three-system landscape as usual.\n\nPlain-language answer:  \nYes, you can add your own button/action in the eDocument Cockpit of S/4HANA Private Cloud; you do it by creating a custom action key in SPRO, coding the logic in BAdI EDOC_ACTION_HANDLER, and exposing the button in the Fiori app via Adapt UI.",

In SAP S/4HANA Cloud, public edition, both Fiori apps\n\n• Manage Electronic Documents (App ID F4306)  \n• eDocument Cockpit (App ID F2915)\n\nare built on the Document & Reporting Compliance framework and are “key-user extensible.”  \nYou can add your own fields and make them available in the list‐report, object page, filters, OData APIs, and even in the XML that is sent to tax authorities.\n\nHow to do it (key-user workflow) – proven by SAP Help outputs above  \n1. Open app “Custom Fields and Logic” (F1481).  \n2. Create → Custom Field.  \n   • Business Context: “Electronic Document – Header” (EDOCUMENT_HEADER) or any other electronic-document context.  \n3. Under “Enable Usage” tick  \n   – UI: Manage Electronic Documents, eDocument Cockpit, etc.  \n   – OData: Electronic Documents (API_EDOC_DOCUMENT_SRV) if needed.  \n4. Publish the field (system appends it to table EDOCUMENT and adds UI annotations).  \n5. If the field must be filled automatically, implement BAdI EDOC_CUSTOM_FIELDS_CLOUD (method FILL_EDOC_CUSTOM_FIELDS) or the per-process BAdI exposed in the Custom Logic app.  \n6. Use “Adapt UI” on the Fiori page to place the new field in:  \n   – the initial document list,  \n   – the object-page header/sections,  \n   – the filter bar.  \n7. Transport via “Manage Software Changes” to Q/P tenants (no SPRO allowed in public cloud).\n\nOptional developer extensibility  \nFor advanced needs (custom XML mapping, separate process flow) you can create a custom electronic-document process class in ABAP Cloud and reuse the same custom fields.\n\nImportant limitations  \n• One custom field is shared by all electronic-document processes; process-specific hiding must be done with UI adaptation.  \n• Classic SPRO enhancements are not available in public-cloud tenants; only key-user or ABAP Cloud is supported.\n\nMini-example  \nCustom field YY1_PROJECTID (10 char) to store project reference.  \n– Created in business context EDOCUMENT_HEADER.  \n– In BAdI code:  \n```abap\nIF is_source_billing IS BOUND.\n  cs_edocument-yy1_projectid_edi = is_source_billing-projk.\nENDIF.\n```  \n– Drag “Project ID” into list and object page via Adapt UI.  \n– Field appears in API_EDOC_DOCUMENT_SRV, so external monitoring tools can filter on it.\n\nPlain-language takeaway  \nYes—you can safely add and populate your own fields in both electronic-document cockpit apps using the standard “Custom Fields and Logic” and “Adapt UI” tools delivered in SAP S/4HANA Cloud (public edition); no backend modifications are needed.",

         "Technical explanation  \nYes – SAP S/4HANA Cloud, public edition (Spain) lets you enhance any delivered eDocument process (for example, AR_EDOC_INVOICE for outgoing invoices) with your own fields. SAP delivers two cloud BAdIs precisely for this purpose:\n\n1. EDOC_CUSTOM_FIELDS_CLOUD  \n   • Called once for every new eDocument.  \n   • Here you move data from the source object (VBRK, BKPF, etc.) into an auto-generated extension structure that contains all custom fields you have created.\n\n2. EDOC_CUSTOM_FIELDS_UI_CLOUD  \n   • Called when the eDocument Cockpit UI is rendered.  \n   • You return the same values so that the field appears in the list/object page.\n\nEnd-to-end steps (taken from SAP Help & official blog – tool outputs [1]-[2])  \n1. Open the “Custom Fields” Fiori app  \n   • Business Context = “Document Compliance”.  \n   • Define the new field (e.g. ZZ1_TOTAL_WEIGHT, data type “Quantity with Unit”).  \n   • Publish → the framework appends the field to CDS view I_EDOC_HDR (and I_EDOC_DOC if detail level needed).\n\n2. Open the “Custom Logic” Fiori app  \n   • Create enhancement for BAdI EDOC_CUSTOM_FIELDS_CLOUD.  \n   • Set mandatory filter “Process” to the eDocument process you want to extend (e.g. AR_EDOC_INVOICE).  \n   • Sample code:\n\n      METHOD if_edoc_custom_fields_cloud~set_custom_fields.  \n        DATA ls_vbrk = VALUE zcl_read_vbrk=>get( iv_vbeln = is_source_data-vbeln ).  \n        es_custom_fields-zz1_total_weight = ls_vbrk-brgew.   \"gross weight  \n        es_custom_fields-zz1_weight_unit = ls_vbrk-gewme.  \n      ENDMETHOD.\n\n   • Save & publish.\n\n3. Still in “Custom Logic”, create a second implementation for BAdI EDOC_CUSTOM_FIELDS_UI_CLOUD with the same filter. Usually:  \n\n      METHOD if_edoc_custom_fields_ui_cloud~get_custom_fields.  \n        es_custom_fields = is_persisted_custom_fields.  \n      ENDMETHOD.\n\n4. Transport via Software Collection, run a test billing document → eDocument Cockpit now shows the new column; the value is also available for value mapping into the XML if needed.\n\nKey points / restrictions for public cloud  \n• Only the above BAdIs are released; classic append structures or SE18 implementations are not allowed.  \n• One BAdI implementation per PROCESS filter is mandatory.  \n• No modification of standard XML mapping is needed unless you want the field to go to the outbound XML; that can be done via value-mapping tables delivered by SAP Document & Reporting Compliance.\n\nPlain-language answer  \nYes, even as a public-cloud customer in Spain you can add your own field to any eDocument process; create the field in “Custom Fields” and populate/display it through the two cloud BAdIs EDOC_CUSTOM_FIELDS_CLOUD and EDOC_CUSTOM_FIELDS_UI_CLOUD.",

         "Technical answer  \nYes. Both Fiori apps support field-level extensibility that can be combined with the built-in authorisation framework to hide or show electronic documents per user:\n\n1. Create a custom field that will carry the “visibility key” (most customers use Sales Office, Company Code, Profit Centre or any other organisational unit).\n   • App Custom Fields and Logic (F1481) → Business context  \n     – Manage Electronic Documents: Electronic Document Header – Additional Data  \n     – eDocument Cockpit: Electronic Document Header – Additional Data  \n   • Mark the field as “Organisational Unit Relevant” (cloud) or include it in CI-include EDOCHDR (on-prem).  \n   • Enable it for “UI & Reports” and for the corresponding OData service of the app, then Publish.\n\n2. Fill the field automatically when the eDocument is created.  \n   • Implement BAdI EDOC_ADJUST_HDR or the Custom-Logic exit “Electronic Document – Determine Additional Fields” and move the organisational value from the source billing / accounting document into the new field.\n\n3. Maintain the list of valid organisational units (SPRO path Cross-Application Components → Electronic Documents → Authorisations → Define Organisational Units or view C_EdocOrgUnit).\n\n4. Add the restriction to business roles.  \n   • Maintain Business Roles → Restriction type “Electronic Document: Restriction for Organisational Unit” → enter allowed values for each role.\n\n5. At runtime the OData service checks CL_EDOC_AUTH_CHECK; documents whose custom-field value is not in the user’s authorised list are not returned, so the user never sees them in Manage Electronic Documents or eDocument Cockpit.\n\nResult: visibility of electronic documents is restricted purely by standard authorisation checks driven by your custom field—no custom UI logic is necessary.\n\nPlain-language summary  \nYes—you can add your own “organisation” field to the eDocument header and use standard role restrictions so that each user only sees the documents that match the value(s) assigned to their role.",

         "Technical explanation  \nYes. In SAP S/4HANA Cloud, public edition for Germany you can suppress ‑ or “de-relevate” – a source document so that no electronic document (eDocument) is generated in either of the two UIs (“Manage Electronic Documents” Fiori app and the legacy “EDOCUMENT_COCKPIT” transaction).  \nThe control point is the public-cloud enhancement spot ES_EDOCUMENT_CLOUD, BAdI EDOC_ADAPTOR_CLOUD, method IF_EDOC_ADAPTOR_CLOUD~IS_RELEVANT.\n\n1. Create a new BAdI implementation (In-App Extensibility → Custom Logic → Enhancement Implementation).  \n   • Enhancement spot:  ES_EDOCUMENT_CLOUD  \n   • BAdI:              EDOC_ADAPTOR_CLOUD  \n   • Filter (optional): Country = DE or specific company code / source type.  \n\n2. In the generated class implement method IS_RELEVANT.  \n   Example skeleton (released ABAP syntax):  \n\n   ```abap\n   METHOD if_edoc_adaptor_cloud~is_relevant.\n     \"Default is always ‘true’ – set to ‘false’ for the cases you want to skip\n     DATA lv_relevant TYPE abap_bool VALUE abap_true.\n\n     \"Sample rule: suppress zero-value billing documents\n     IF is_source_data-doc_type = 'SD_BILL'\n        AND is_source_data-net_amount = 0.\n       lv_relevant = abap_false.\n     ENDIF.\n\n     \"Return to framework\n     cv_relevant = lv_relevant.\n   ENDMETHOD.\n   ```\n\n3. Activate and transport the implementation.  \n   • When the condition evaluates to FALSE:  \n     – Automatic creation at posting time is skipped.  \n     – In the apps the document appears with status “Not relevant for eDocument”; a manual “Create” action will trigger message EDOCUMENT 164 and still not create the entry.  \n\nEvidence from tools  \n• SAP documentation summary (“Determine Relevance for eDocument in the public cloud”) – confirms that EDOC_ADAPTOR_CLOUD→IS_RELEVANT is the standard hook and that setting CV_RELEVANT = FALSE prevents creation.  \n• SAP Community blog “How to prevent creation of Electronic Documents for zero value invoices” – shows the identical implementation pattern and resulting cockpit behaviour.  \n\nKey points  \n• Pure configuration cannot express complex “if … then not relevant” rules; the BAdI is the supported way in public cloud.  \n• Works for all source document categories (SD billing, FI, MM, etc.) provided your filter logic identifies them.  \n• No custom field access needed unless the rule depends on them; those are available in IS_RELEVANT via the structure IS_SOURCE_DATA.  \n\nPlain-language answer  \nYes—you can stop the system from creating an eInvoice or other eDocument when your own business conditions apply by adding a small piece of custom logic (BAdI EDOC_ADAPTOR_CLOUD). When the rule returns “not relevant,” the Manage Electronic Documents and eDocument Cockpit apps will no longer allow the document to be created.",

         "Technical explanation  \nYes. In SAP S/4HANA Cloud, public edition, the XML that is created for a Turkish e-Invoice (eFatura) can be post-processed in the ABAP Development Tools (ADT) before it is saved and dispatched to the tax authority.  \nThe framework exposes developer-level BAdI EDOC_ADAPTOR_CLOUD (enhancement spot ES_EDOCUMENT_CLOUD).  When the eDocument cockpit job has produced the standard XML via the AIF mapping class, the runtime calls this BAdI:\n\n1. Standard mapping → produces initial UBL XML.  \n2. BAdI EDOC_ADAPTOR_CLOUD->ADAPT_XML( ) is invoked.  \n3. Your code can add new nodes/attributes, change values, or raise errors.  \n4. The adjusted XML is persisted and then transferred to the Turkish tax system.\n\nImplementation steps in ADT  \na) Prerequisites  \n   • Business role DEVELOPER for the cloud tenant.  \n   • ADT project connected to the tenant.\n\nb) Create the implementation  \n   ADT → File > New > ABAP Class → “BAdI implementation”.  \n   – Choose enhancement spot ES_EDOCUMENT_CLOUD, BAdI EDOC_ADAPTOR_CLOUD.  \n   – Name e.g. ZCL_EDOC_ADAPTOR_TR.  \n\nc) Maintain filter values so the BAdI is called only for Turkish invoices:  \n   COUNTRY        = ‘TR’  \n   PROCESS        = ‘INV’ (customer invoice)  \n   PROCESS_VERSION= ‘1’  (as delivered)  \n   SOURCE_TYPE    = ‘SD’ (or FI, as relevant)  \n   GENERIC_FILTER = (optional free string)  \n\nd) Code sample (simplified)  \n```abap\nMETHOD adapt_xml.              \"signature visible in ADT\n  DATA(lo_doc) = io_xml_doc.   \"DOM object\n\n  \"Example: add delivery number as <cac:DespatchDocumentReference>\n  DATA(lo_root) = lo_doc->get_root_element( ).\n  DATA(lo_inv)  = lo_root->get_first_child( ).\n  DATA(lo_add)  = lo_doc->create_simple_element(\n                     name = 'cac:DespatchDocumentReference'\n                     value = is_source_data-delivery_num ).\n  lo_inv->append_child( lo_add ).\nENDMETHOD.\n```\ne) Activate and transport; no SPRO or SSCUI activity is needed.\n\nUseful variants  \n• If you only need to pass custom fields (created via “Custom Fields & Logic”), use BAdI EDOC_CUSTOM_FIELDS_CLOUD instead—this avoids manual XML manipulation.  \n• You can drive multiple adaptor implementations via method CHANGE_ADAPTOR_GENERIC_FILTER of interface IF_EDOC_SOURCE_PROCESS_EXT when finer routing is required.\n\nImpact & safeguards  \n• The BAdI executes before the file is stored and sent, so any validation errors you raise will appear in the cockpit log and stop submission.  \n• Always adhere to the UBL/TR eFatura XSD namespaces; otherwise the authority portal will reject the document.\n\nPlain-language takeaway  \nYes—you can open the file in the cloud’s developer tools, change or add XML tags through a standard enhancement (BAdI EDOC_ADAPTOR_CLOUD), and the system will send your modified version to the Turkish tax authority.",

Choose the implementation channel  \n   • Key user (no ADT): Fiori app “Custom Logic” → Create → Business Context “eDocument : Greece”, BAdI “Cloud EDOC Adaptor BADI: Modify final invoice XML”.  \n   • Developer: ABAP Development Tools → create a class that implements BAdI EDOC_ADAPTOR_CLOUD.\n\n2. Set the BAdI filter so it runs only for Greek documents  \n   COUNTRY = ‘GR’  \n   PROCESS = ‘GR_INV_OUT’, ‘GR_INV_IN’, or ‘GR_EBOOKS’ (as required).\n\n3. Code your changes in method IF_EDOC_ADAPTOR_CLOUD~MODIFY_XML_DOC  \n   • Read or create XML nodes via the io_xml helper interface.  \n   • Fill optional tags (e.g. PaymentMethodDetails, VAT-exemption text) or adjust values.  \n   • Optional: raise cx_edoc_adaptor to block submission and write an error that will be shown in the cockpit.\n\n   Example (key user syntax):  \n\n   ```\n   \"YY1_EDOC_ADAPTOR_GR\n   DATA lv_fuel TYPE abap_bool.\n   lv_fuel = edocument-get_cust_field( 'FUEL_INVOICE' ).\n\n   IF lv_fuel = abap_true.\n     DATA(lo_elem) = io_xml->create_element( iv_name = 'FuelInfo' ).\n     lo_elem->set_value( 'True' ).\n     io_xml->add_child( lo_elem ).\n   ENDIF.\n   ```\n\n4. Activate and transport (the Custom Logic app publishes automatically; ADT class must be activated in DEV and transported).\n\n5. Test  \n   • Post an SD/MM invoice, open it in eDocument Cockpit.  \n   • Use “XML Preview” to verify the enhancement.  \n   • Submit; the modified XML is forwarded to AIF, CI/IS, and then AADE myDATA.  \n   • Any error you raised is visible in the cockpit log; user can fix data and press Resubmit.\n\nPrerequisites  \n• Greece DRC scope items (5XU, BD9) are active.  \n• eDocument types are assigned to billing, accounting and MM documents.  \n• Value mappings cover any new codes you insert.\n\nResult  \nAfter these steps the XML produced for Greek e-Invoices, e-Books or consolidated documents is enriched or corrected exactly as defined in your BAdI logic and the change is visible in both the Manage Electronic Documents app and the eDocument Cockpit.\n\nPlain-language takeaway  \nCreate or activate the BAdI EDOC_ADAPTOR_CLOUD (filter GR) in Custom Logic or ADT, add your ABAP code in method MODIFY_XML_DOC, and the system will automatically output the enhanced XML whenever you preview or submit Greek eDocuments.",

         "Technical explanation  \n1. Where the e-mail is built  \n   • When you press “Customer” in the Fiori app Manage Electronic Documents, framework CA-GTF-CSC-EDO calls BAdI EDOC_PART_CONN_CHANGE_EMAIL_V2 just before the message is handed over to Output Management.  \n   • The BAdI receives:  \n     – CS_EMAIL_DATA (subject, body (text + HTML), sender/receiver)  \n     – CT_ATTACHMENTS (table of XSTRING attachments)  \n     – CS_ERROR (return).  \n   • Any changes you make are what the customer finally receives.\n\n2. How to enhance it in SAP S/4HANA Public Cloud (Germany Customer Invoice scenario)  \n   a. Open Fiori app “Custom Logic” (App ID F1481).  \n   b. Create → Extension Point → search for EDOC_PART_CONN_CHANGE_EMAIL_V2 → New Implementation.  \n   c. Paste ABAP-for-Cloud code, for example:\n\n```abap\n\" Change subject and plain-text body\ncs_email_data-subject = |Ihre Rechnung { cs_email_data-doc_number }/{ cs_email_data-fiscal_year }|.\ncs_email_data-body_txt =\n  |Sehr geehrte Damen und Herren,{ cl_abap_char_utilities=>newline }|\n  & |anbei erhalten Sie Ihre elektronische Rechnung als PDF und XRechnung.|.\n\n\" Add an extra PDF attachment (e.g. T&C)\nDATA ls_att TYPE edoc_s_email_att.\nls_att-file_name    = |AGB_DE.pdf|.\nls_att-mime_type    = |application/pdf|.\nls_att-file_content = lv_terms_and_conditions_pdf.   \"XSTRING\nAPPEND ls_att TO ct_attachments.\n```\n\n   d. Publish and Activate.\n\n3. Make sure the mail can actually be sent  \n   • SSCUI 105065 (Output Parameter Determination – E-mail): channel = EMAIL, receiver role = BP, correct form template.  \n   • SSCUI 104405 (Maintain E-Mail Sender Addresses): maintain a sender for the company code.  \n   • Communication Arrangement SAP_COM_0461 (or 0276) must be active so Cloud SMTP service can deliver the mail.\n\n4. Testing  \n   • In Manage Electronic Documents, pick a German customer invoice whose status = “Validation Passed”.  \n   • Press Customer → the preview now shows the modified subject/body plus any new attachments.  \n   • Complete the process and check the mail in the recipient’s inbox.\n\nKey points confirmed by SAP documentation/tools  \n✓ EDOC_PART_CONN_CHANGE_EMAIL_V2 is the official enhancement spot for e-mail subject, body, addresses and attachments (SAP Help & eDocument extensibility guide).  \n✓ It works for Germany Customer Invoice and all other country processes because it is located in the generic partner-connector layer.  \n✓ Implementation is 100 % key-user compliant—no classic SE80 needed.\n\nPlain-language one-liner  \nUse the Custom Logic app to implement BAdI EDOC_PART_CONN_CHANGE_EMAIL_V2, where you adjust the subject, body and attachments of the e-mail that the Manage Electronic Documents app sends for German customer invoices.",

         "The generated answer is partially helpful in addressing the question about implementation steps to restrict eDocument creation for Public Cloud customers in Spain. Here's the reasoning:\n\n1. Alignment with expert answer and tool context:\n   - The generated answer doesn't mention the specific steps outlined in the expert answer, such as creating an implementation for enhancement spot ES_DOCUMENT_CLOUD or implementing the BAdI EDOC_ADAPTOR_CLOUD.\n   - It does, however, provide alternative methods to restrict eDocument creation, which could be valid approaches.\n\n2. Completeness:\n   - The generated answer offers multiple approaches to restrict eDocument creation, including configuration changes and BAdI implementation.\n   - It provides more detailed implementation steps and code examples than the expert answer.\n\n3. Accuracy:\n   - The information about using the CBC activity \"Assign E-Document Procedure to Billing Type / Company Code\" seems accurate and relevant.\n   - The BAdI implementation steps are different from those in the expert answer but may still be valid for achieving the desired result.\n\n4. Relevance to Public Cloud and Spain:\n   - The answer specifically mentions \"SAP S/4HANA Cloud, public edition – Spain\" and provides Spain-specific examples, which aligns with the question's context.\n\n5. Additional valuable information:\n   - The generated answer includes steps for removing manual-creation authorizations and archiving existing eDocuments, which weren't mentioned in the expert answer but could be helpful.\n   - It also provides a minimal end-to-end test scenario, which adds practical value.\n\nWhile the generated answer provides helpful information and approaches to restrict eDocument creation, it doesn't fully align with the specific implementation steps outlined in the expert answer and the tool-provided context. This discrepancy makes it partially helpful rather than fully helpful. The answer offers alternative methods that may be valid but doesn't cover the exact BAdI implementation steps (EDOC_ADAPTOR_CLOUD) mentioned in both the expert answer and the tool context.",

         "Technical explanation (SAP S/4HANA Cloud, public edition – Spain)\n\n1. Decide whether configuration alone is sufficient  \n   • CBC activity “Assign E-Document Procedure to Billing Type / Company Code”  \n     – For billing or FI document types that must never create an eDocument, simply delete the mapping row.  \n     – Result: when the source document is posted, the Electronic Document Processing Framework (EDPF) is not called and nothing appears in Manage Electronic Documents or the Cockpit.\n\n2. If you need more granular logic, implement the filter BAdI  \n   a. Prerequisites: 3-system landscape, Developer Extensibility, role SAP_BR_ADMINISTRATOR_DEV.  \n   b. In ADT (Eclipse) create an Enhancement Implementation for BAdI “Electronic Document Processing Filter” (technical name varies; in Spain it is delivered with interface IF_EDOC_PROC_FILTER).  \n   c. Implement method CHECK_RELEVANCE; return abap_false for cases you want to block, e.g.  \n      ```\n      METHOD if_edoc_proc_filter~check_relevance.\n        \"Example: allow only Spain company codes ES01 and ES02\n        IF i_s_source_header-bukrs IN VALUE #( ( 'ES01' ) ( 'ES02' ) ).\n          r_relevant = abap_true.\n        ELSE.\n          r_relevant = abap_false.   \"No eDocument created\n        ENDIF.\n      ENDMETHOD.\n      ```  \n   d. Activate and transport → Q → P. From now on the “Create” button or any background job will silently skip documents that fail the check; nothing enters tables EDOCUMENT / EDOCUMENTH, therefore nothing shows up in the apps.\n\n3. Remove manual-creation authorisations (optional but recommended)  \n   • In the business role(s) assigned to end-users, delete authorisation object EDOC_PROC with activity 01 (create).  \n   • Users can still post the invoice, but the “Create” or “Retry” actions inside Manage Electronic Documents / Cockpit are greyed out.\n\n4. (Optional) Hide existing eDocuments by archiving/ILM  \n   • If some records were already created, run “Manage Archiving Variants” → object EDOCUMENT → write/delete or ILM with residence period 0.  \n   • This is not preventive but keeps the cockpit empty.\n\nMinimal end-to-end test  \n1. Post SD billing type F2 in company code ES10 (not allowed) → check table EDOCUMENT = 0 lines.  \n2. Post SD billing type F2 in company code ES01 (allowed) → status “In Process” visible in Manage Electronic Documents.  \n3. User without EDOC_PROC 01 opens Cockpit: Create button is not offered.\n\nPlain-language summary  \nIn Spain’s public-cloud tenant you stop eDocuments by (1) deleting the relevant mapping in CBC, or (2) coding the delivered filter BAdI so it returns “not relevant”; optionally remove create authorisations. Then no document enters the Manage Electronic Documents or eDocument Cockpit apps.",

         "Technical explanation  \nIn SAP S/4HANA Cloud, public edition, a “new process” for Electronic Document Processing (EDP) is nothing more than an additional Process ID that you model in the eDocument framework and implement with released ABAP-for-Cloud objects. The two SAP Help extracts (see tool outputs) agree on the exact building blocks.  \n1. Prerequisites  \n   • 3-system landscape (DEV / QAS / PROD) with Developer Extensibility enabled  \n   • ABAP Development Tools (ADT) in Eclipse  \n   • Licences: SAP Document & Reporting Compliance + SAP Integration Suite  \n\n2. Model the process (no coding yet)  \n   App “eDocument Process Manager” → create a new Process ID (e.g. Z_B2B_PEPPOL).  \n   – Define lifecycle statuses (CREATED, SENT, ACK, …).  \n   – Define actions (CREATE_FROM_HOOK, SUBMIT, GET_STATUS, CANCEL, …).  \n   – Decide which status transitions each action triggers.  \n\n3. Generate ABAP skeletons in ADT  \n   • Business-object class implementing IF_EDOCUMENT_PROCESS  \n   • One class per action implementing IF_EDOCUMENT_ACTION_<ACTION>  \n   • A mapping class implementing IF_EDOCUMENT_MAPPER  \n\n4. Implement CREATE_FROM_HOOK action  \n   – Enhance the relevant source application BAdI (e.g. SD billing) to call your process.  \n   – Read source document (VBRK/VBRP, BKPF/BSEG, …).  \n   – Fill EDOCUMENT_HEADER / ITEM structures and call SAVE( ).  \n\n5. Implement SUBMIT action  \n   – Build internal XML via your mapper (XSLT or ABAP transform).  \n   – Persist payload in table EDOSFILE, change status to “SENT_TO_INTERFACE”.  \n   – Call CL_EDOCUMENT_EXT_ES→PROCESS_REQ_SEND_GLOBAL or your own service proxy; receive track-ID and update EDOCUMENT-TRACK_ID.  \n\n6. Optional extra actions (e.g. SEND_TO_CUSTOMER)  \n   – Use CL_BCS to e-mail PDF copy.  \n   – Update status accordingly.  \n\n7. Configuration link to company codes  \n   CBC → SSCUI 105387 “Assign eDocument Process to Company Codes”.  \n\n8. Integration Suite flow  \n   – Deploy/adapt the iFlow the framework calls.  \n   – Map internal XML fields to Peppol/UBL/CIUS etc.  \n\n9. Transport & Test  \n   – ABAP artefacts via gCTS / ABAP Git; customizing via CBC.  \n   – Unit‐test your classes; run Manage Electronic Documents (F2743) in DEV.  \n\n10. Monitoring  \n   – Cockpit apps automatically show the new process.  \n   – Payload in EDOSFILE, status log in EDOSTATUS, runtime errors in SLG1 (object EDOCUMENT).  \n\nMini-snippet – storing an eDocument in the CREATE action  \n```abap\nDATA(ls_header) = VALUE edocument_header(\n                    process_id   = 'Z_B2B_PEPPOL'\n                    objkey       = lv_vbeln\n                    company_code = lv_bukrs\n                  ).\nDATA(lt_item) = VALUE edocument_items( ).\n\"…fill items…\n\nio_process->set_header( ls_header ).\nio_process->set_items(  lt_item  ).\nio_process->save( ).\n```\n\nPlain-language summary  \nUse the Process Manager app to define the life-cycle of your new e-invoice (statuses + actions), then implement the generated ABAP classes (one for the overall process, one per action, plus a mapper) and connect them to the framework; finally assign the process to company codes and deploy an Integration Suite flow. Once transported, the new process appears automatically in the Manage Electronic Documents and eDocument Cockpit apps, enabling legally compliant e-invoicing without touching SAP standard code.",

SAP BTP landing zone for DRC  \n   • A global account with the service “SAP Document and Reporting Compliance, cloud edition” enabled.  \n   • Initial setup (manual or Booster) executed once per BTP sub-account.\n\n2. Secure trust between S/4HANA Cloud and the DRC cloud service  \n   • Signed SSL client certificate imported into the S/4HANA Cloud tenant.  \n   • Service binding in BTP created → copy the generated OAuth client ID/secret & endpoint URL.  \n   • Communication System + Communication Arrangement in S/4HANA Cloud that points to that URL.\n\n3. Landscape & extensibility model selected  \n   • Decide whether the new process will be built with  \n     – Side-by-Side extensibility (iFlows / Event Mesh on SAP Integration Suite) or  \n     – Developer extensibility (embedded ABAP; requires a 3-system landscape).  \n   • Corresponding transport mechanism ready (Cloud TMS or CTS+, and/or Software Collections).\n\n4. Authorizations and business roles  \n   • S/4HANA Cloud:  \n     – SAP_BR_CONF_EXPERT_BUS_NET_INT (maintain communication arrangements)  \n     – SAP_BR_EXTENSIBILITY_SPEC (create custom fields/BAdIs used in the new process)  \n   • SAP BTP / Integration Suite: AuthGroup.Administrator and IntegrationDeveloper.\n\n5. APIs, exits and data model exposure  \n   • Released OData service API_EDOCUMENT_SRV activated.  \n   • Any custom fields added via “Custom Fields & Logic” and whitelisted for eDocument runtime.  \n   • If Developer extensibility is chosen, the BAdI EDOCUMENT_ENHANCEMENT or relevant CDS views must be enabled in the development tenant.\n\n6. Connectivity from DRC cloud back to S/4HANA Cloud  \n   • “Outbound” connection in DRC cloud configured with the technical user created above so the cloud service can post status updates or inbound documents.\n\nOnce these six items are satisfied, the “Create Process” wizard in the DRC cloud edition (or the corresponding configuration in S/4HANA Cloud) becomes active and you can design the new statutory eDocument or report flow.\n\nPlain-language summary  \nBefore you can press “Create new DRC process” in the public-cloud system, you must (1) finish the one-time BTP setup for DRC, (2) establish a trusted, certificate-based connection between S/4HANA Cloud and the DRC cloud service, (3) pick and prepare your extensibility approach, (4) have the right business roles, (5) activate the released eDocument APIs/BAdIs or iFlow exit points you intend to use, and (6) configure the reverse connection so DRC can talk back to S/4HANA Cloud.\n\nMini-snippet example  \n• Service binding output in BTP  \n  \"clientid\":\"sb-7ac…\",  \n  \"clientsecret\":\"****\",  \n  \"url\":\"https://drc-srv.cfapps.eu10.hana.ondemand.com\"  \n\n• Communication Arrangement in S/4HANA Cloud  \n  Scenario: SAP_COM_0599  \n  Service URL: https://drc-srv.cfapps.eu10.hana.ondemand.com  \n  Authentication: OAuth2 Client-Credentials (ID/Secret from binding)\n\nWith these prerequisites in place, you can open SAP Document and Reporting Compliance, choose “Manage Processes” → “Create”, and define your new compliant eDocument or statutory reporting process.",

         "Technical answer  \nYes—on SAP S/4HANA Cloud, public edition you are allowed to create and use your own database tables for a Document & Reporting Compliance (DRC) localisation that you build yourself, provided you stay within the two cloud-approved extensibility channels:\n\n1. Developer Extensibility (ABAP Cloud, 3-system landscape)  \n   • In ABAP Development Tools you can create a “Database Table” object (customer namespace /Z* or /X*).  \n   • From release 2308 you can also add secondary and extension indexes.  \n   • The table can be read or updated in any DRC-released BAdI (e.g. EDOC_ADAPTOR_CLOUD) and exposed through CDS/RAP if you want UI or OData access.  \n   • You must respect the Cloud ABAP subset (no cluster/pool tables, no unreleased APIs) and handle authorisations/ILM yourself.\n\n2. Key-User Extensibility (2- or 3-system landscape)  \n   • Launchpad → app “Custom Fields & Logic” → tab “Custom Database Tables”.  \n   • Generates a YY1/YYB* table plus a CDS view and OData service.  \n   • No direct ABAP access; you consume the data via the generated service inside Manage Electronic Documents or a custom UI.\n\nWhat the documentation says (tool evidence)  \n• SAP Help lookup explicitly lists both options and links them to DRC (“extend the Manage Electronic Documents app with custom electronic-document processes”).  \n• The DRC extensibility FAQ summarised in the internal docs stresses that BAdI EDOC_ADAPTOR_CLOUD is available only for Developer Extensibility, confirming the technical path to read/write your custom table.  \n• No SAP note forbids table creation; the only caveat is that you cannot upload data coming from an external ERP and store it in S/4HANA Cloud via DRC—end-to-end processes must start in S/4HANA Cloud.\n\nMini example (Developer Extensibility)  \nADT – New → Database Table ZDRC_CN_MAP  \nFields: MANDT, COMPANY_CODE (key), TAX_ID, PEPPOL_ID, …  \nActivate → create CDS YY1_DRC_CN_MAP and RAP behaviour.  \nBAdI implementation ZCL_BADI_EDOC_CN → read ZDRC_CN_MAP to enrich the outgoing XML.\n\nPlain-language summary  \nYou can indeed build your own tables in the public cloud and plug them into your DRC localisation—use ADT in a 3-system landscape for full control or the “Custom Database Tables” app for simpler needs, and make sure you call those tables only through the cloud-released DRC BAdIs or generated services.",

         "Answer in a nutshell  \nYes. SAP S/4HANA Cloud, public edition exposes a released interface (IF_EDOCUMENT_EXT_ES) and several released BAdIs that let you create and register your own ABAP class to extend DRC/ACR “process-mapping” logic. Development is done in ADT (Eclipse) under the Developer-Extensibility model; activation happens via the Fiori/SSCUI apps, not via classic SE24.\n\nTechnical explanation  \n1. Released anchor  \n   • IF_EDOCUMENT_EXT_ES – contract C1 (“use system-internally”) since release 2502.  \n   • Purpose: lets a custom class enrich / convert the eDocument data model during a DRC process step.\n\n2. Development steps  \n   a. In ADT create class ZZCL_EDOC_MAP_<country> PUBLIC FINAL  \n      – add “Interfaces IF_EDOCUMENT_EXT_ES”.  \n      – redefine method MAP_DATA( ) or other interface methods to manipulate ET_XMLOUT / CT_MODEL.  \n   b. Only use objects that are marked “released” (views I_*, data elements, APIs).  \n   c. Activate and transport via gCTS (automatic in public cloud).  \n\n3. Registration / runtime  \n   – Fiori app “Define eDocument Extended Interface Implementations” (or SSCUI ID 105646) → enter class name and country.  \n   – DRC runtime calls your class automatically during document creation / update.  \n\n4. Complementary BAdIs (also released for developer & key-user extensibility)  \n   • BADI_MM_SI_ODN_MODIFY – ODN for MM invoices.  \n   • BADI_SD_BD_ODN_MODIFY – ODN for SD billing.  \n   • NFE_CLOUD_EXTENSIBILITY – add custom fields to Brazilian Nota Fiscal XML.  \n   Implement them the same way (ADT → “New BAdI Implementation”).  \n\n5. Limitations in public cloud  \n   • No direct table updates, no unreleased APIs.  \n   • Classic GUI workbench transactions (SE24, SM30) are read-only.  \n   • Follow naming convention ZCL_* or YY1_* prescribed by SAP.  \n\nCode sketch  \n\nCLASS zzcl_edoc_map_it DEFINITION  \n  PUBLIC FINAL  \n  CREATE PUBLIC.  \n  PUBLIC SECTION.  \n    INTERFACES if_edocument_ext_es.  \nENDCLASS.  \n\nCLASS zzcl_edoc_map_it IMPLEMENTATION.  \n  METHOD if_edocument_ext_es~map_data.  \n    \"Example: add withholding-tax indicator  \n    LOOP AT ct_model ASSIGNING FIELD-SYMBOL(<fs>).  \n      IF <fs>-country = 'IT'.  \n        <fs>-withholding_tax = 'W1'.  \n      ENDIF.  \n    ENDLOOP.  \n  ENDMETHOD.  \nENDCLASS.  \n\nOnce saved and registered, every Italian eInvoice processed by DRC will pass through this logic.\n\nPlain-language takeaway  \nYou can indeed write your own ABAP class in the public-cloud system to tweak how DRC builds or enriches electronic documents; SAP has provided an official hook (interface and BAdIs) for exactly that purpose.",

Which ABAP handler class must be instantiated for the country/region.  \n2. Which eDocument process name and version have to be executed for that source document.\n\nThe BAdI’s interface IF_EDOCUMENT_BASE_EXT therefore contains exactly two methods:\n\n• DETERMINE_EDOCUMENT_CLASS → returns cv_edoc_class_name (e.g. ‘ZCL_EDOC_BR_HANDLER’)  \n• DETERMINE_PROCESS    → returns cv_process_name and cv_process_version (e.g. ‘BR_NF’, ‘0001’)\n\nHow it fits into the flow\n1. A source document reaches the eDocument “hook”.  \n2. Factory class CL_EDOC_FACTORY_EXT (configured per source document type) runs.  \n3. CL_EDOC_FACTORY_EXT executes BAdI EDOCUMENT_BASE_EXT with the current filter (usually CTRY).  \n4. The values your implementation returns tell the factory which handler to create and which process definition to follow.  \n5. The handler class then orchestrates the remaining eDocument steps (mapping, posting to PEPPOL/SDI, status handling, …).\n\nMinimal sample implementation\n\n```\nMETHOD if_edocument_base_ext~determine_edocument_class.\n  cv_edoc_class_name = 'ZCL_EDOC_US_HANDLER'.\nENDMETHOD.\n\nMETHOD if_edocument_base_ext~determine_process.\n  IF is_edocument-source_type = 'SD_INVOICE'.\n    cv_process_name    = 'US_SD_INV'.\n    cv_process_version = '0001'.\n  ENDIF.\nENDMETHOD.\n```\n\nKey points\n• Exactly one implementation must return values; use filter CTRY to separate countries.  \n• Factory class CL_EDOC_FACTORY_EXT must be entered in IMG activity “Activate Additional eDocument Instance Creation” for the relevant source type.  \n• The process name/version you return must exist in the Fiori app “Manage eDocument Process” (table EDOPROC).  \n• If the BAdI does not return a handler class or process, no eDocument is created.\n\nPlain-language summary  \nThe BAdI EDOCUMENT_BASE_EXT tells SAP which country-specific handler and which eDocument process to run whenever an electronic document is created—essentially it routes every new eDocument to the correct logic.",

         "Technical explanation  \nImplementing BAdI EDOCUMENT_BASE_EXT in S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition lets you tell the eDocument framework which handler class and which “Process / Version” must be used when an electronic document is created for Spain.  \nAll development is carried out in ABAP Development Tools (ADT); no on-prem SE18/SE24 is available in Public Cloud.\n\nStep-by-step procedure  \n\n1. Preparation  \n   • In configuration app “Manage eDocument Process” create (or make sure you already have)  \n      – Process Name & Version that will be used for Spain (e.g. “ES_EINV” version “0001”).  \n   • If you need a second eDocument per source document, activate factory class CL_EDOC_FACTORY_EXT for the relevant Source Type (e.g. SD_INVOICE) in SSCUI “Activate Additional eDocument Instance Creation”.  \n   • Create (in ADT) a country handler class that inherits from CL_EDOCUMENT_EXT_ES; this will contain the business logic for Spain (XML creation, mapping, web-service calls etc.).  \n\n2. Create enhancement implementation  \n   • In ADT choose “New → Enhancement Implementation”.  \n   • Enhancement Spot: ES_EDOCUMENT_EXT.  \n   • Within the enhancement add a BAdI implementation for BAdI EDOCUMENT_BASE_EXT.  \n\n3. Maintain filter values (mandatory)  \n   • COUNTRY = ‘ES’  (Spain ISO code).  \n   • Optionally also filter on SOURCE_TYPE (e.g. ‘SD_INVOICE’) to avoid conflicts.  \n   • Keep only one active implementation per country / source-type because the framework keeps the values coming from the LAST implementation executed.  \n\n4. Implement the ABAP class  \n   The implementing class must expose both interfaces: IF_BADI_INTERFACE and IF_EDOCUMENT_BASE_EXT.  \n   Sample skeleton (replace class names with your own):  \n\n   ```\n   CLASS zcl_edoc_base_ext_es DEFINITION PUBLIC FINAL.\n     PUBLIC SECTION.\n       INTERFACES if_badi_interface.\n       INTERFACES if_edocument_base_ext.\n   ENDCLASS.\n\n   CLASS zcl_edoc_base_ext_es IMPLEMENTATION.\n     \" Return the country handler class\n     METHOD if_edocument_base_ext~determine_edocument_class.\n       cv_edoc_class_name = 'ZCL_EDOC_ES_HANDLER'.   \"← your subclass of CL_EDOCUMENT_EXT_ES\n     ENDMETHOD.\n\n     \" Return the process/key that cockpit should use\n     METHOD if_edocument_base_ext~determine_process.\n       IF is_edocument-source_type = 'SD_INVOICE'.\n         cv_process_name    = 'ES_EINV'.\n         cv_process_version = '0001'.\n       ENDIF.\n     ENDMETHOD.\n   ENDCLASS.\n   ```\n\n5. Activate  \n   • Activate the BAdI implementation object and the class in ADT.  \n   • Add both objects to your Software Collection and transport them with the “Export / Import Collection” Fiori apps.  \n\n6. Runtime check  \n   • Post or select a billing document.  \n   • Framework calls CL_EDOC_FACTORY_EXT → BAdI EDOCUMENT_BASE_EXT.  \n   • Your BAdI returns ZCL_EDOC_ES_HANDLER + process “ES_EINV/0001”.  \n   • Handler class (sub-class of CL_EDOCUMENT_EXT_ES) performs mapping, signs XML, sends to AEAT (or other Spanish endpoint).  \n\n7. Optional integration BAdIs  \n   • EDOCUMENT_INT_CONN_EXT – implement if you need custom HTTP/SOAP logic; typical pattern is to delegate to CL_EDOCUMENT_EXT_ES→process_req_send_global.  \n   • EDOCUMENT_MESSAGE_EXT – implement if you want to enrich cockpit messages.  \n\nKey points / tips  \n• All code must use only “Released for Cloud” objects (CL_EDOCUMENT_EXT_ES, IF_EDOC_EXT_DATATYPES, …).  \n• Process name & version returned by the BAdI MUST exactly match what is maintained in “Manage eDocument Process”; otherwise creation fails in cockpit.  \n• Debugging: set an external breakpoint in your BAdI class, choose “External Debugging” in ADT, then run the cockpit step again.  \n\nPlain-language summary  \nCreate an enhancement implementation for ES_EDOCUMENT_EXT, filter it to Spain (‘ES’), code two short methods that tell the framework which Spanish handler class and which eDocument process/version to use, activate and transport—your Spanish eInvoicing process is now plugged into the S/4HANA Cloud eDocument framework via BAdI EDOCUMENT_BASE_EXT.",

Registers the new process in the EDP (Electronic Document Processing) framework  \n   • Country/region and business-document category (e.g. SD billing, FI supplier invoice)  \n   • The ABAP process class that extracts data, calls mappings, sends/receives messages and writes status back (tool output #2 §1)\n\n2. Links all runtime artefacts that make the process work  \n   • Mapping object (XSLT, CPI iFlow or mapping class) that turns SAP data into the legally-required XML/JSON/UBL/Peppol format  \n   • Persistence layout in EDOC_* tables so the cockpit apps can store payload and status  \n   • Number-range object for the internal eDocument ID and, if required, the official document number (tool output #2 §1 & §4)\n\n3. Exposes the process to the Fiori “Manage Electronic Documents” cockpit  \n   • Only eDocument Types entered in configuration activity “Define Electronic Document Types” (SSCUI 105405) appear in the cockpit where users monitor, resend or download the files (tool output #2 §4)\n\n4. Enables legal compliance controls  \n   • Validation/enrichment BAdIs, signature logic, sender/receiver IDs and status handling are all triggered by the eDocument Type and its process class (tool output #1 bullets 2–3)\n\nWithout an eDocument Type the framework has no anchor-point to:  \n• know which source documents are relevant,  \n• run your custom mapping or BAdIs,  \n• store the generated XML/JSON, or  \n• show the document in the user cockpit.  \n\nHence SAP requires you to create (or copy) an eDocument Type before any other configuration when you develop a new DRC process in the public cloud.\n\nPlain-language takeaway  \nThink of the eDocument Type as the “folder” that tells DRC what the new legal document is, how to build it, where to send it and how to display it—so you must create that folder first.",

Maintain an electronic-document type for each object you will receive (invoice, sales order, etc.)  \n   • SPRO → Electronic Documents → Define Electronic Document Types and allocate a status profile that contains NEW, MAPPED, POSTED, COMPLETED, ERROR.\n\n3. Provide a communication path from the outside world to S/4HANA Private Cloud  \n   a) Recommended: SAP Integration Suite  \n      – Copy the SAP-delivered iFlow for the scenario, set the receiver URL to the SOAP endpoint you create in SOAMANAGER (step 5) and maintain user/password.  \n   b) Alternative: SAP PEPPOL Exchange (if you receive PEPPOL BIS 3 invoices) – register the endpoint, download the certificate and import it into STRUST.\n\n4. Create technical users and RFC/HTTP destinations  \n   • SU01 → communication user (e.g. EDOC_INB) with role SAP_BR_EDOCUMENT_SPECIALIST.  \n   • SM59 → (optional) HTTP destination to Integration Suite for future acknowledgements.\n\n5. Generate the ABAP web-service endpoint that the iFlow calls  \n   • SOAMANAGER → Web Service Configuration → search inbound proxy (e.g. CO_EDOC_INBOUND_REQ).  \n   • Create binding (SOAP 1.1, SSL, Basic Auth) and copy the service URL for the iFlow.\n\n6. Configure Application Interface Framework (AIF) for mapping & posting  \n   • /AIF/CUST → Define Interface (/EDOC/<TYPE>_IN).  \n   • Assign XML structure, recipient logical system, value-mapping group (upload mapping sheet if delivered).  \n   • Posting FM in the interface parameters – e.g. EDOC_POST_ACC_INB.\n\n7. (If needed) Implement BAdI EDOC_INTERFACE_CONNECTOR for custom preprocessing; set Direction = 2 (Inbound).\n\n8. Define number ranges and posting profile  \n   • SPRO → Electronic Documents → Assign Number Ranges.  \n   • SPRO → Electronic Documents → Define Posting Profile and link the inbound posting FM.\n\n9.

         "Technical explanation (step-by-step)\n\n1. Prerequisites  \n   • Scope item 5XU – “Document and Reporting Compliance – Framework Extensibility” is activated.  \n   • A custom eDocument Interface (GUID) is already created in Fiori app “Manage eDocument Interfaces”.  \n   • You have developer authorizations in SAP S/4HANA Cloud, public edition (ADT or Business Application Studio).\n\n2. Create the country/region handler class  \n   a. In ADT choose File ▶ New ▶ ABAP Class.  \n   b. Name: ZCL_EDOC_EXT_<XX>  (XX = ISO country/region code, e.g. ZCL_EDOC_EXT_US)  \n   c. Description: “Country/Region Handler – DRC Extensibility”.  \n   d. Public section – add released interface IF_EDOC_EXT_DATATYPES for easy access to framework types.\n\n3. Declare the mandatory framework methods (public)  \n\n   ```\n   METHODS process_create\n     IMPORTING  iv_interface_guid   TYPE if_edoc_ext_datatypes=>mty_interface_edoc_guid\n                iv_process_step     TYPE if_edoc_ext_datatypes=>mty_edoc_process_step\n                iv_variant          TYPE if_edoc_ext_datatypes=>mty_edoc_proc_step_var\n                io_edocument_ext_es TYPE REF TO cl_edocument_ext_es\n     RETURNING  VALUE(rv_result)    TYPE if_edoc_ext_datatypes=>mty_edoc_process_step\n     RAISING    cx_edocument_ext.\n\n   METHODS handleException\n     IMPORTING  io_edocument_ext_es TYPE REF TO cl_edocument_ext_es\n                ix_edocument_ext    TYPE REF TO cx_edocument_ext\n     RAISING    cx_edocument_ext.\n   ```\n\n   Add further process-step methods you intend to use, e.g. PROCESS_MAP, PROCESS_SUBMIT, PROCESS_STATUS, PROCESS_RECEIVE, PROCESS_REQUEST_SEND, PROCESS_TRIGGER_SEND, PROCESS_SEND_TO_CUSTOMER, etc., each with the same signature template.\n\n4. Implement the methods  \n   • Within PROCESS_CREATE call helper io_edocument_ext_es→process_create_global( … ) to build the eDocument shell, write any country-specific data, and return next process step (usually ‘MAP’).  \n   • For outbound communication steps reuse framework helpers, e.g.  \n     ```\n     io_edocument_ext_es->process_req_send_global( ).\n     ```  \n   • Always WRAP logic in TRY…CATCH cx_edocument_ext and delegate to HANDLEEXCEPTION.  \n   • HANDLEEXCEPTION must write application log, set cockpit status to “Error” with io_edocument_ext_es→update_error_flag( ) and RAISE EXCEPTION.\n\n5. (Optional) Map data & call web-service proxies  \n   • Implement a MAP_* method that transforms SAP source tables to the request proxy structure.  \n   • Implement CALL_PROXY_* method that builds a HTTP destination via CL_SOAP_DESTINATION_PROVIDER and invokes the proxy class (generated from your Communication Scenario/Arrangement).\n\n6. Activate supporting BAdIs  \n   • EDOCUMENT_BASE_EXT – to decide when cockpit should create an eDocument of your new type.  \n   • EDOCUMENT_INT_CONN_EXT – if you need to override standard web-service connectivity.\n\n7. Configure the process in the Fiori app “Manage eDocument Process”  \n   • Create Process → enter description and select the Interface GUID you prepared.  \n   • Technical Settings → Country/Region Handler Class = ZCL_EDOC_EXT_<XX>.  \n   • For every process step (CREATE, MAP, SUBMIT, …) pick the corresponding method name exactly as it appears in your class. Save & activate the process.\n\n8. Test end-to-end  \n   • Post a business document that triggers the BAdI and creates an eDocument.  \n   • Monitor lifecycle in app “Manage Electronic Documents” (cockpit).  \n   • If errors occur, consult application log object EDOCUMENT with your interface GUID.\n\nMini-snippet – PROCESS_CREATE template\n\n```\nMETHOD process_create.\n  TRY.\n      io_edocument_ext_es->process_create_global(\n        EXPORTING iv_interface_guid = iv_interface_guid\n                  iv_variant       = iv_variant ).\n      rv_result = if_edoc_ext_datatypes=>co_step_map.   \"next step\n    CATCH cx_edocument_ext INTO DATA(lx_edoc).\n      handleException( io_edocument_ext_es = io_edocument_ext_es\n                       ix_edocument_ext    = lx_edoc ).\n  ENDTRY.\nENDMETHOD.\n```\n\nPlain-language summary  \nTo make the DRC framework run your own country logic in SAP S/4HANA Cloud you build one ABAP class called ZCL_EDOC_EXT_XX, add a standard set of methods (PROCESS_CREATE, MAP, SUBMIT, …), implement them with the helper class CL_EDOCUMENT_EXT_ES, and then point the “Manage eDocument Process” app to that class. From then on every eDocument for that country executes the code in your handler class.",

         "Technical explanation (what you must configure)\n\n1. Create an Inbound Technical User  \n   • Fiori app “Maintain Communication Users”  \n   • Choose authentication method (Basic user/password, client certificate, or OAuth/SAML token).  \n   • Example: EDOC_IN_USER.\n\n2. Define the External System in SAP  \n   • Fiori app “Communication Systems”  \n   • System ID e.g. EXT_EDOC_SYS, System Type = “Inbound Only”.  \n   • Assign the technical user from step 1 in the “Inbound Communication User” section.  \n   • Upload the sender’s certificate or trust configuration if you use cert- or token-based authentication.\n\n3. Create a Communication Arrangement  \n   • Fiori app “Communication Arrangements” → New  \n   • Select the SAP-delivered Communication Scenario that matches inbound eDocument processing in private-edition:  \n     – Most common: SAP_COM_0636 “Document Compliance – Inbound Processing”  \n     – Or SAP_COM_0057 “Document Compliance Monitoring” (older releases / monitoring only).  \n   • Enter an Arrangement name (e.g. EDOC_IN_ARR) and pick the Communication System from step 2.  \n   • The required inbound service (SOAP/OData) is auto-added; on Save the system generates the service endpoint URL—hand this URL to your middleware / external sender.\n\n4. Optional arrangement refinements  \n   • “Additional Properties” tab – restrict to specific Company Codes.  \n   • Activate HTTP security sessions if required (header x-sap-security-session, see SAP Notes 3201227, 3319136).\n\n5. eDocument customizing inside SAP (IMG)  \n   • Financial Accounting → Document Compliance → eDocument → Inbound Processing  \n   • Ensure mapping of inbound XML to EDOC_HEADER/ITEM structures (SAP-provided XSLT or CPI iFlows).  \n   • FIN_EDOCUMENT_1 business function is active by default in S/4HANA Cloud, private edition.\n\n6. Monitoring & testing  \n   • Fiori app “Display Connectivity Trace” – confirm the external system can reach the endpoint.  \n   • Application Interface Framework (/AIF/ERR, /AIF/IFMON) – monitor or reprocess inbound messages.  \n   • eDocument Cockpit – verify that the incoming document is created.\n\nWhy two independent tool sources agree  \nBoth SAP Help (generic inbound integration article set) and SAP Document and Reporting Compliance documentation list exactly the same three mandatory objects—Communication User, Communication System, Communication Arrangement—plus the eDocument-specific IMG settings. No conflicting steps were found.\n\nExample snippet (basic-auth flow)  \nExternal HTTP POST → https://my123456-api.s4hana.ondemand.com/sap/bc/srt/xip/sap/edocinbound…  \nHeader: Authorization: Basic RURPQ19JTl9VU0VSOlNhcFBhc3MxMjM=  \nPayload: <eDocumentInvoice …/>\n\nPlain-language summary  \nBefore your external system can push eDocuments into an SAP S/4HANA Cloud, private-edition tenant you must (1) create an inbound technical user, (2) register the external system and link that user, (3) build a communication arrangement based on scenario SAP_COM_0636 (or similar) to generate the service URL, and (4) make sure the eDocument inbound customizing and monitoring tools are active—once these four areas are set up, the external sender can successfully transmit documents to SAP.",

         "Technical answer  \nYes. SAP Document & Reporting Compliance for Greece exposes a dedicated enhancement spot that lets you change or enrich the XML of a customer invoice immediately before it is shipped to the tax authorities (myDATA).\n\n1. Core enhancement  \n   • Business Context (Fiori “Custom Logic” app): eDocument – Greece  \n   • BAdI name: “Cloud EDOC Adaptor BADI: Modify final invoice XML”  \n   • Method: MODIFY_FINAL_INVOICE_XML  \n   • Key import/export parameters  \n     – CH_FINAL_XML (string/xstring) – the complete XML; change it in-place  \n     – CT_MESSAGES (return table) – add error/warning messages; on error the document stays in status “Error” in the cockpit  \n   • Call point: after AIF field mapping, just before the payload is handed to SAP Cloud Integration / Integration Suite.\n\n2.

         "Technical explanation  \nThe SAP-delivered documentation (see tool outputs “sap_help_lookup” & “sap_documentation_summary”) lists four mandatory checkpoints that must be fulfilled before you start building a brand-new electronic-document process with the DRC extensibility framework:\n\n1. Scope Confirmation  \n   • Make sure a new development is really required (verify country/region is not already covered by a standard DRC process).  \n   • If you intend to use a standard source document (e.g. customer invoice, supplier invoice) you must reuse the existing eDocument type – do NOT create a parallel type.  (Doc-summary #1 & #2)\n\n2. Framework & Country Readiness  \n   • Country/Region code must exist in view EDOEXTCOUNTRYV.  \n     – Missing entry → open an SAP support ticket in component CA-GTF-CSC-EDO-EXT.  (Doc-summary #3)  \n   • Mandatory security: activate Read Access Logging (RAL) for Channel “Electronic Document” before productive use (sap_help_lookup “Read Access Logging” section).\n\n3. Authorisations, Tools and Naming  \n   • Business catalog SAP_FIN_BC_SRF_CONF_PC (plus role SAP_BR_ADMINISTRATOR) is required to open the “Define Statutory Reports” Fiori app.  \n   • IMG authorisation SAP_BR_BPC_EXPERT is needed if you plan to deactivate the SAP report activity later.  \n   • Fiori / UI apps that must be available:  \n     – Define Statutory Reports (F2543)  \n     – Run Statutory Reports (F2544)  \n     – Custom Fields & Logic (F1481)  \n     – Custom CDS Views (F1866)  \n   • All customer artefacts have to live in the YY1_ namespace.  (sap_help_lookup “Authorizations / Naming Conventions”)\n\n4. Development Setup  \n   • Create a customer development package in your own namespace in SE80/ADT to store CDS views, classes, and BW queries needed by the process.  (Doc-summary #4)  \n   • Copy – never modify – the closest SAP report definition or eDocument type.  \n   • Maintain the file type and structure in IMG step “Maintain eDocument Types and File Types” (table EDOC_CUST) so the cockpit and RAL can recognise your new document.\n\nQuick checklist you can tick off before development starts\n----------------------------------------------------------  \n☐ Confirm no standard DRC scenario already fits the requirement.  \n☐ Country/Region available in EDOEXTCOUNTRYV; if not, ticket raised.  \n☐ RAL activated for channel “Electronic Document”.  \n☐ Business catalog SAP_FIN_BC_SRF_CONF_PC and role SAP_BR_ADMINISTRATOR assigned.  \n☐ Fiori apps F2543, F2544, F1481, F1866 available in the landscape.  \n☐ Customer development package and YY1_ namespace prepared.  \n☐ File type & structure maintained in EDOC_CUST.  \n☐ (Optional) Plan to deactivate the SAP standard reporting activity after your copy is assigned.\n\nExample snippet – creating the RAL configuration  \n\n• Transaction SRALMANAGER → Create Configuration  \n  Channel = “Electronic Document”  \n  Key Fields:  \n     EDOC_TYPE = PT_INV (your new or reused type)  \n     FILE_TYPE = XML  \n  Activate.\n\nPlain-language summary  \nBefore you start building a brand-new compliance process in DRC, first make sure the country is enabled, the necessary Fiori apps and authorisations are in place, read-access logging is switched on, a customer namespace/package exists, and the standard objects you will copy (eDocument type or ACR report) are ready to be extended rather than modified directly.",

         "Technical explanation (step-by-step)  \n1. Find the enhancement point that SAP exposes for the Greece XML  \n   • Business context: “eDocument: Greece”  \n   • Cloud BAdI: EDOC_CLD_ADAPTOR_MODIFY_XML (catalog name “Cloud EDOC Adaptor – Modify Final Invoice XML”).  \n   This BAdI is called once the Application Interface Framework (AIF) has produced the complete myDATA XML, but before it is handed to Integration Suite and ultimately AADE.\n\n2. Create the implementation in ADT (ABAP Development Tools/Eclipse)  \n   a. In the ABAP Cloud Project open:  File → New → Enhancement Implementation.  \n   b. Choose Business Context “eDocument: Greece” and select the adaptor BAdI above.  \n   c. Accept the proposed implementation class (e.g. ZCL_EDOC_GR_MODIFY_XML).  \n   d. ADT opens method IF_EDOC_CLD_MODIFY_XML~MODIFY_XML for coding.\n\n3. Code the XML enhancement logic  \n   METHOD if_edoc_cld_modify_xml~modify_xml.  \n     DATA: lt_xml TYPE string.  \n     lt_xml = ch_final_xml.          \"full XML received from SAP mapping  \n     \"Example 1 – insert PaymentTerms node  \n     REPLACE FIRST OCCURRENCE OF '</InvoiceHeader>'  \n       IN lt_xml WITH |<PaymentTerms>30</PaymentTerms></InvoiceHeader>|.  \n\n     \"Example 2 – consistency check  \n     IF lt_xml CP '*<NetAmount>0*'.  \n       cv_block_process = abap_true.  \n       APPEND VALUE #( msgid = 'EDOC_GR' msgno = '133'  \n                       msgty = 'E'  msgv1 = 'Net amount is zero' )  \n              TO ct_error_messages.  \n     ENDIF.  \n\n     ch_final_xml = lt_xml.  \n   ENDMETHOD.\n\n   Important parameters  \n   • CH_FINAL_XML – export/import; supply the adjusted XML string.  \n   • CT_ERROR_MESSAGES – add messages that cockpit should display.  \n   • CV_BLOCK_PROCESS  – flag X to cancel processing (status “Rejected by BAdI”).\n\n4. Activate and transport  \n   • Activate the enhancement implementation (Ctrl+F3).  \n   • Include it in the normal transport / gCTS request and move to Q → P system – no further customizing or job scheduling is needed.\n\n5. Test end-to-end  \n   1. Post a sample invoice (e.g. VF01).  \n   2. Open EDOC_COCKPIT / Fiori “Manage Electronic Documents” – status should be “eDocument Created”.  \n   3. Schedule/trigger job “Schedule eDocument Jobs – General” (program EDOC_RUN); the BAdI will fire.  \n   4. In a breakpoint or SLG1 (object EDOC_GR) verify the XML is changed.  \n   5.

Key-user (in-app) extensibility  \n   • Use the Fiori “Custom Logic” app to implement delivered BAdIs under the business context “eDocument: Italy – Document Compliance”.  \n   • Typical exits  \n     – EDOC_CHECK_CREATION_BADI Skip/allow eDocument creation.  \n     – ITALY_XML_FILLING_BADI Add or change XML nodes before submission.  \n     – EDOC_PARTNER_CONNECTOR_BADI Adapt the e-mail sent to customers when SDI cannot deliver the invoice.  \n   • No transport needed; activation is immediate in the current client.\n\n2. Developer (classic) extensibility  \n   • In ADT/SE18 create an enhancement implementation in spot EDOCUMENT_FWK_EXT (e.g. class ZCL_EDOC_IT_EXT).  \n   • Override interface methods such as IF_EDOCUMENT_XML_MODIFY~MODIFY_BEFORE_SEND to enrich the FatturaPA XML or attach additional documents (Base64 → xstring).  \n   • Transport through the DEV/Q/P landscape; fully allowed in Private Cloud.\n\nReference objects mentioned in SAP Help  \n• Cockpit: Fiori app “eDocument Cockpit” (EDOC_COCKPIT)  \n• Tables: EDOC_HEADER, EDOC_ITEM, EDOS for status; extension field structure EDOCUMENT_S_UI_EXT  \n• Jobs: “Schedule eDocument Jobs” or background job EDOCUMENT_SUBMIT – unchanged by your BAdIs.\n\nSHORT EXAMPLES  \n• Add tag <Causale> for each line: implement ITALY_XML_FILLING_BADI, read VBRP-MATNR, append XML node under <DatiBeniServizi>.  \n• Suppress eDocument for pro-forma bills: implement EDOC_CHECK_CREATION_BADI, exit with ABAP statement CHECK vbrk-fkart <> ‘F5’.  \n• Custom e-mail body: implement PARTNER_CONNECTOR_BADI, build HTML body and set CH_EMAIL_CONTENT.\n\nPLAIN-LANGUAGE SUMMARY  \nBecause Private-Cloud systems permit both key-user and developer BAdI exits, you are free to add fields, change the XML, or influence when an Italian eInvoice is created and sent—so yes, you can extend the existing eDocument customer-invoice process.",

         "Technical explanation  \n1. Standard cockpit “actions” (Create, Submit, Resubmit, Cancel, Download XML …) are hard-coded in the Fiori Elements list page that ships with app EDOC_COCKPIT.  \n   – You cannot register a brand-new action in the ABAP back-end-only; the UI must also expose a button.  \n   – What SAP does allow is to change what the standard actions do (or whether they run at all) by means of BAdIs delivered in enhancement spot ES_EDOCUMENT_CORE / _CLOUD.  \n        • EDOC_CHECK_EDOC_CREATE  - decide if an eDocument should be created.  \n        • EDOC_MODIFY_FINAL_XML  - change the XML just before it is sent.  \n        • EDOC_CUSTOM_FIELDS*   - fill / validate own fields that appear on the list page.  \n\n2. If your requirement is “reuse an existing button but run extra logic” → implement the relevant BAdI.  \n   Example (ABAP, ADT or Fiori “Custom Logic”):  \n\n   METHOD if_edoc_adaptor_cloud~modify_final_xml.  \n     DATA lr_node TYPE REF TO if_ixml_element.  \n     lr_node = io_xml->get_root_element( )->append_child( ).  \n     lr_node->set_name( 'Z:MyCustomNode' ).  \n     lr_node->set_value( lv_value ).  \n   ENDMETHOD.\n\n   Raising an exception (cx_static_check) stops the action and writes the error to the cockpit log.\n\n3. If you really need a brand-new action (your own button that triggers a “custom developed process”):  \n   a. Use Key-User UI adaptation or SAP BAS extension project for the Fiori Elements app.  \n      • “Add Action” creates an OData function import (e.g. ZEDOC_PROCESS).  \n      • The button appears next to the standard ones and is only enabled for the rows you mark.  \n   b. Implement the OData service operation in ABAP RAP or SEGW; typical implementation simply calls your own class ZCL_EDOC_CUSTOM_PROC which reads the selected EDOCUMENT keys and performs whatever you need (generate another XML, post to CPI, etc.).  \n   c. Authorisations: check EDOCUMENT key + any custom field you added (SU21 object that reads table EDOCUMENTEXT).  \n   d. Transport like any other UI5 / ABAP artefact; works the same in S/4HANA Private Cloud as on-prem.\n\n   No modification of SAP standard is required—everything sits in your own namespace and survives upgrades.\n\n4. Summary of what is possible without UI extension vs. with UI extension  \n\n   | Requirement | Only BAdI needed? | Needs UI5 extension? | Tooling |\n   |-------------|------------------|----------------------|---------|\n   | Decide whether “Create” runs | ✔ | – | BADI_EDM_CHECK_EDOC_CREATE |\n   | Change payload before “Submit” | ✔ | – | BADI_EDM_MODIFY_FINAL_XML |\n   | Show extra columns / use them in filters | ✔ | – | Custom Fields + BADI_EDM_CUSTOM_FIELDS* |\n   | New button “Send to XYZ Network” | – | ✔ | UI5 Adaptation + custom OData + ABAP class |\n\nPlain-language answer  \nYes—you can change what the existing cockpit actions do via the delivered BAdIs, and in Private Cloud you can even add your own button by extending the Fiori app and calling a custom ABAP implementation; both approaches are upgrade-safe and fully supported.",

In SAP S/4HANA Private Cloud you can restrict what each user sees in the Fiori app “eDocument Cockpit / Manage Electronic Documents” by adding your own field to the eDocument header and activating the delivered “additional authorization check”:\n\n1. Add custom field  \n   • Fiori App: Custom Fields & Logic  \n   • Business context: Document and Reporting Compliance – eDocument Header  \n   • Usage: Analytics + UI (List Report)  \n   → Field is appended to DDIC include EDOCUMENT_HDR_EXT and appears in CDS view I_EDocument/OData service C_EDocument used by the cockpit list.\n\n2. Fill the field automatically during eDocument creation  \n   • Implement BAdI: EDO_COCKPIT_EXTENSION_BADI  \n   • Copy the required value (e.g. Sales Org, Plant, Profit Center) from VBRK/BKPF into changing parameter CS_EDOC_HEADER-<your_field>.\n\n   Example ABAP (ADT):  \n   ```\n   METHOD if_edo_cockpit_extension_badi~fill_extension_fields.\n     IF cs_edoc_header-edoc_type = 'AR_E_INVOICE'.\n       SELECT SINGLE vkorg FROM vbrk\n         WHERE vbeln = cs_src_data-billing_doc\n         INTO cs_edoc_header-zz_salesorg.      \"custom field\n     ENDIF.\n   ENDMETHOD.\n   ```\n\n3.

Switch on the runtime check  \n   SPRO → “Perform Authorisation Checks for Organisational Unit”.  \n   At runtime class CL_EDO_UI_HELPER compares the field value with auth. object /EDO/ORGU (field ORG_UNIT, activity 03). Unauthorised rows are removed before the cockpit list is sent to the UI.\n\n5. Maintain roles  \n   SU21 → object /EDO/ORGU (already delivered)  \n   PFCG → add it to roles and enter allowed org values (e.g. VKORG = 1000).\n\nResult  \nUsers only see electronic documents whose custom-field value matches their ORG_UNIT authorisation.\n\nPlain-language summary  \nIn Private Cloud you can hide or show individual eDocuments per user by creating a cockpit header custom field (e.g. Sales Org), populating it during document creation, and activating the built-in DRC “organisational unit” authorisation check that filters the cockpit list accordingly.",
