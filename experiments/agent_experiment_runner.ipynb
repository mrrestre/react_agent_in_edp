         "Technical explanation (developer-level)  \n1. Where to enhance  \n   • Use the developer-extensibility BAdI EDOC_ADAPTOR_CLOUD (Enhancement Spot ES_EDOCUMENT_CLOUD).  \n   • The framework builds the standard XML → then calls this BAdI → whatever you add here becomes part of the legal output that is stored in table EDOCUMENTFILE and sent to the network/authority.\n\n2. Method to use for attachments  \n   • Implement interface method SET_OUTPUT_DATA (name can differ slightly by release; check IF_EDOC_ADAPTOR_CLOUD in ADT).  \n   • The importing/changing parameters contain:  \n     – CS_OUTPUT_DATA (XML payload)  \n     – CT_ATTACHMENTS  (table for binary or text files)  \n     – XML_FILE_MODIFIED (structure for “in-XML” changes; e.g. node AdditionalDocumentReference).\n\n3. Filling the CT_ATTACHMENTS table  \n   The structure looks like this (short form):  \n     ATTACHM_TYPE        MIME-type, e.g. ‘application/pdf’  \n     ATTACHM_SUBJECT     Filename or description  \n     ATTACHM_LANGUAGE    (optional) ISO code  \n     CONTENT_HEX         XSTRING with the binary (preferred)  \n     CONTENT_TEXT        TABLE OF CHAR255 if you cannot use XSTRING  \n     ATTACHM_HEADER      (optional) Base64 header line  \n\n   Example code snippet:\n\n```\nMETHOD if_edoc_adaptor_cloud~set_output_data.\n  DATA ls_att TYPE edoc_s_attachment.\n\n* Read a PDF that you want to send together with the invoice\n  ls_att-attachm_type    = 'application/pdf'.\n  ls_att-attachm_subject = 'DeliveryNote_4711.pdf'.\n  ls_att-content_hex     = zcl_file_tool=>get_file_as_xstring( iv_path = '/usr/tmp/delnote_4711.pdf' ).\n\n  APPEND ls_att TO ct_attachments.\n\n* --- OPTIONAL: embed a reference directly into the XML ------------\n  DATA ls_ref TYPE add_document_reference.\n  ls_ref-issuer_assigned_id = 'DN4711'.\n  ls_ref-document_type_code = 'A007'.          \"Peppol example\n  APPEND ls_ref TO xml_file_modified-additional_document_reference.\nENDMETHOD.\n```\n\n4. Rules for the content  \n   • If you fill CONTENT_HEX the framework automatically converts it to Base64 and splits it into 255-char lines.  \n   • Max. file size is checked against country/process limits (method CHECK_MAX_FILE_SIZE in the framework).  \n   • You can attach several files—append one line per file.  \n\n5.

         "Technical explanation (step-by-step)\n\n1. Identify the correct Cloud BAdI  \n   • For all Greece MyDATA scenarios in SAP S/4HANA Cloud, public edition, the framework calls BAdI EDOC_ADAPTOR_CLOUD (enhancement spot ES_EDOCUMENT_CLOUD).  \n   • This is the only developer BAdI that can overwrite / enrich the XML created by the standard mapping.\n\n2. Create the enhancement implementation in ADT  \n   a. In Eclipse/ADT choose File → New → ABAP BAdI Implementation.  \n   b. Enhancement Spot: ES_EDOCUMENT_CLOUD  \n   c. BAdI Definition: EDOC_ADAPTOR_CLOUD  \n   d. Choose a filter value for field GENERIC_FILTER (e.g. ‘GR_XML’) if you need more than one variant.  \n   e. ADT generates a class, for example ZCL_EDOC_ADAPTOR_GR.\n\n3. (Optional) Steer the call with a source-process extension  \n   • Implement interface IF_EDOC_SOURCE_PROCESS_EXT in a helper class (e.g. ZCL_EDOC_EXT_BILLING).  \n   • In method CHANGE_ADAPTOR_GENERIC_FILTER set cv_generic_filter = ‘GR_XML’.  \n   • This guarantees that only invoices that fulfil your own logic trigger the BAdI implementation.\n\n4. Add your XML enrichment code  \n   • Implement method MAP_XML_DATA (or MAP_XML_DATA_ADD, name depends on SP).  \n   • Importing parameter IS_XML_DATA (structure that mirrors the default XML) – read / change it.  \n   • If you need to add entirely new tags use the generic extension table ET_EXTENSION_DATA.  \n   • Typical pattern:  \n     DATA lr_root TYPE REF TO xsdany.                                \"root node  \n     lr_root->*-NewTAG = ‘CUSTOM VALUE’.  \n   • When finished, assign the changed structure to the changing parameter CS_XML_DATA_MODIFIED or RETURN_CODE = abap_true.  \n   • Do not forget error handling:  \n     ASSERT <conditions>.  \n     or  \n     RAISE EXCEPTION TYPE /ECR/EDOCUMENT_CLOUD=>CX_EDOC_ADAPTOR.\n\n5. Activate and transport  \n   • Activate the enhancement implementation and any helper classes.  \n   • Add them to a software collection and release through Cloud Transport Management or gCTS.\n\n6. Test in the Manage Electronic Documents app  \n   • Create/replicate a billing document.  \n   • Open the electronic-document log → section “Adaptors executed”.  \n   • Your class should appear; double-click to display the modified XML.  \n   • Resubmit; the framework now sends the enriched XML to the AADE MyDATA endpoint.\n\nShort code extract (MAP_XML_DATA)  \n\nMETHOD if_edoc_adaptor_cloud~map_xml_data.  \n  DATA ls_xml TYPE edo_ubl_invoice.    \n  ls_xml = is_xml_data.               \"start from standard mapping  \n  \"Add Customer Material Number  \n  ls_xml-SuppliersItemIdentification-ID = is_source-vbrp-matnr.  \n  \"Pass back to framework  \n  cs_xml_data_modified = ls_xml.  \nENDMETHOD.\n\nPlain-language summary  \nIn the public-cloud system you enrich Greece MyDATA XML by building a developer-extensibility enhancement (EDOC_ADAPTOR_CLOUD) in ADT, coding the extra tags in its MAP_XML_DATA method, activating and transporting it, and then verifying the new XML in the Manage Electronic Documents app before it is sent to the tax authority.",

(sap_help_lookup result)\n\nHow to use it  \n1. In ADT create an implementation of EDOC_ADAPTOR_CLOUD (e.g. ZCL_EDOC_GR_ADAPTOR).  \n2. Maintain a filter so that it is triggered only for Greek eDocuments – either  \n   • COUNTRY = ‘GR’ (if the filter is available) or  \n   • GENERIC_FILTER = ‘GR_EXT’ and supply that value from your source-process extension class.  \n3. Implement one or more of the interface methods:  \n   – MAP_SOURCE_2_XML / MODIFY_XML → change or add XML nodes.  \n   – CHECK_CREATE_EDOCUMENT → suppress creation for unwanted invoices.  \n   – CHECK_CANCEL_EDOCUMENT → control cancellation rules.  \n4. Activate and test via the Fiori app “Manage Electronic Documents” (EDOC_COCKPIT). Any errors you raise appear in the cockpit log; when corrected, the user can resubmit.\n\nExample snippet (inside MODIFY_XML)  \n```\nMETHOD if_edoc_adaptor_cloud~modify_xml.\n  DATA(lo_xml) = io_xml_document->get_dom( ).\n  \"Add delivery number\n  lo_xml->create_simple_element(\n        name        = 'DeliveryReference'\n        value       = is_source_data-vbeln ).\nENDMETHOD.\n```\n\nResult: the extra <DeliveryReference> tag is inserted in the XML sent to AADE.\n\nPlain-language summary  \nYes—you can insert, change, or validate data in the Greece e-invoice XML before it is transmitted by implementing BAdI EDOC_ADAPTOR_CLOUD, filtered for country GR, in your S/4HANA Public Cloud tenant.",

         "Technical answer  \nYes. In SAP S/4HANA Cloud, public edition you are allowed to enhance the delivered “Spain – Customer Invoice (Veri*Factu)” eDocument process, but only through the extensibility points that SAP has released for public-cloud use. You cannot copy the standard flow or register a brand-new process; you can only add logic to the existing one.\n\nSupported extension options (confirmed by SAP Help and DRC documentation)  \n\n1. BAdIs in the enhancement spot ES_EDOCUMENT_CLOUD  \n   • EDOC_ADAPTOR_CLOUD – enrich or overwrite individual XML tags (e.g. add customer material number).  \n   • EDOC_CH_XML_FILE (generic) – manipulate the whole XML after standard mapping.  \n   • EDOCUMENT_INT_CONN_EXT – expose the final XML in “Manage Electronic Documents”.  \n\n2. Developer-extensibility classes/interfaces (released as of CE 2308 / 2502)  \n   • IF_EDOCUMENT_EXT_ES → methods for cancellation control and hard deletion.  \n   • CL_EDOCUMENT_EXT_ES → PROCESS_DELETE_GLOBAL etc.  \n\n3. Key-user Custom Logic app  \n   • Same BAdIs can be implemented in an in-app (no-ADT) mode for simple field derivations or e-mail text changes.\n\n4. Configuration that must stay untouched  \n   • eDocument type ES_CI and process definition shipped by SAP cannot be renamed or replaced.  \n   • You must keep communication via SAP Document and Reporting Compliance, cloud edition; only the payload mapping/status logic is extensible.\n\nPrerequisites  \n• 3-system public-cloud tenant with Developer Extensibility activated.  \n• Scope item 5XU “Activate Document & Reporting Compliance Features”.  \n• Company-code linking in “Activate Source Type Documents for Company Code”.  \n\nCode snippet example (ADT):  \n\n```\nCLASS zcl_es_ci_xml_ext DEFINITION\n  PUBLIC\n  FINAL\n  CREATE PUBLIC .\n\n  INTERFACES: if_badi_interface,          \"generated by Custom Logic\n             edoc_adaptor_cloud.\n\nENDCLASS.\n\nCLASS zcl_es_ci_xml_ext IMPLEMENTATION.\n\n  METHOD edoc_adaptor_cloud~change_xml.\n* Append delivery number into <InvoiceLine> node\n    DATA(lo_item) = xml_document->find_node( path = '/Invoice/InvoiceLine[last()]' ).\n    lo_item->create_simple_element(\n       name      = 'DeliveryNumber'\n       value     = is_source_doc-delivery_no ).\n  ENDMETHOD.\n\nENDCLASS.\n```\n\nResult: the additional <DeliveryNumber> tag is included before the XML is handed to SAP DRC and forwarded to AEAT.\n\nOne-sentence summary  \nAs a Spanish public-cloud customer you can’t clone or build a new eDocument process, but you can legally extend the standard Spain customer-invoice flow by implementing the released BAdIs and developer-extensibility objects to add or change XML fields, status logic, or cancellation behaviour.",

         "Technical answer  \nYes – in SAP S/4HANA Cloud, public edition for Italy you can enhance the delivered eDocument customer-invoice (Fattura PA/SDI) process. SAP has released a dedicated extensibility layer and several BAdIs/interfaces that are explicitly available in the public-cloud tenant:\n\n1. Mapping/BAdI layer  \n   • Interface IF_EDOCUMENT_EXT_IT (released under component CA-GTF-CSC-EDO-EXT)  \n     – Implement method MAP_DATA to inject or overwrite XML tags after the standard mapping run.  \n     – Typical usages: set CIG/CUP numbers, add withholding-tax details, change split-payment flags, pass header or item texts to <Causale> or <AltriDatiGestionali>.  \n     – Create the enhancement either in the “Custom Logic” app (key-user) or with ABAP Development Tools in Eclipse (developer extensibility).  \n\n2. Additional hooks that are often used together with Italian SDI  \n   • BADI_SD_BD_ODN_MODIFY and BADI_MM_SI_ODN_MODIFY – adapt the Official Document Number (ODN) written into the XML.  \n   • BADI_FKK_ADJUST_FILE_NAME_C – change the *.xml.p7m file name before transmission to SDI.  \n\n3. Runtime behaviour  \n   – Your implementation is called automatically by class CL_EDOC_MAP_IT → method CALL_CLOUD_BADIs during XML creation (tool output [1]).  \n   – No SSCUI switch is needed; activation of eDocument for Italy (SSCUI 102617) plus a working communication arrangement SAP_COM_0658 is sufficient.  \n\n4. Preconditions  \n   – License for SAP Document and Reporting Compliance.  \n   – Subscription to SAP Integration Suite (for the SDI connection).  \n\nSmall code example (ADT)  \n\n```abap\nCLASS zcl_edoc_it_extension DEFINITION\n  PUBLIC\n  FINAL\n  CREATE PUBLIC .\n\n  PUBLIC SECTION.\n    INTERFACES if_edocument_ext_it.\nENDCLASS.\n\nCLASS zcl_edoc_it_extension IMPLEMENTATION.\n  METHOD if_edocument_ext_it~map_data.\n    \"Add CIG number taken from sales order\n    READ TABLE mt_fields ASSIGNING FIELD-SYMBOL(<ls_field>)\n      WITH KEY name = 'CIG'.\n    IF sy-subrc = 0.\n      <ls_field>-value = is_source-doc->get_cig( ).\n    ENDIF.\n  ENDMETHOD.\nENDCLASS.\n```\n\nAfter activation, simulate the invoice in app “Manage Electronic Documents”; the new value appears in the generated XML.\n\nPlain-language summary  \nYes—you can tailor the standard Italian e-invoice flow in SAP S/4HANA Cloud by implementing the released BAdIs/interfaces; this lets you add or change XML fields, ODN numbers, or file names without leaving the public-cloud scope.",

         "Technical explanation  \n• In SAP S/4HANA Cloud, public edition (Turkey localization), the Document & Reporting Compliance framework exposes key-user BAdIs (for example EDOC_TRC_FILL_HEADER_INV, EDOC_TRC_GENERATE_INVID, etc.) that let you enrich data inside the standard “Create / Submit / Cancel / Download” actions delivered by SAP.  \n• However the framework does not allow you to create new cockpit actions or change the behaviour flow of an existing action (“extend an action”) in Public Cloud.  \n  – SAP’s extensibility FAQ explicitly states: “Enhancement of eDocument Action in the Public Cloud is not supported at the moment.”  \n  – Custom logic is therefore limited to field manipulation, ID generation, e-mail text, authorisation checks, etc., but the action list itself remains fixed and is controlled by SAP.\n\nWhat you can do instead  \n1. Use the Custom Logic app to implement the Turkey-specific BAdIs delivered by SAP – this lets you adapt header/line XML content, decide export relevance, change the e-mail sent to customers, etc.  \n2. If a completely new submission flow (“custom-developed process”) is required, build it side-by-side on SAP BTP (for example via Integration Suite) and call it from a custom Fiori app or job, but it will run outside the eDocument Cockpit’s action set.  \n3. Monitor SAP roadmap; cockpit action extensibility is currently not on the released scope for Public Cloud.\n\nPlain-language summary  \nNo—Public Cloud customers in Turkey cannot add or extend eDocument cockpit actions; you may only adjust the data that SAP’s predefined actions process, or build a separate side-by-side solution.",

Accuracy: The generated answer correctly states that Actions cannot be extended in Public Cloud, which aligns with the expert answer. This is the most crucial part of the response and is accurate.\n\n2. Comprehensiveness: The answer provides a detailed explanation of what can and cannot be done in terms of extensibility in the eDocument Cockpit in SAP S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition. It mentions available extension options like adding custom fields, adapting mapping, and UI personalization.\n\n3. Context: The answer provides good context about the limitations in Public Cloud and explains why Actions cannot be extended, mentioning that classic on-premise activities are not available in Public Cloud.\n\n4. Alternative solutions: The generated answer goes beyond the simple \"No\" of the expert answer and provides alternative approaches for implementing additional steps in a custom process, such as side-by-side extensions, separate Fiori apps, or background jobs.\n\nHowever, there are a few reasons why the answer is not fully helpful:\n\n1. Overemphasis on alternatives: While providing alternative solutions is valuable, the answer spends a significant portion discussing these alternatives, which wasn't explicitly asked for in the original question.\n\n2. Lack of direct confirmation: The answer doesn't start with a clear, direct \"No\" as the expert answer does. Instead, it begins with a technical explanation, which might be less immediately clear to some users.\n\n3. Potential confusion: The detailed explanations about what can be extended (fields, mapping) might lead some users to think that there are ways to extend Actions indirectly, even though this is not the case.\n\nIn summary, while the generated answer provides accurate and valuable information, it could be more concise and direct in addressing the specific question about extending Actions. The additional context and alternatives are helpful but may overshadow the main point for some users.",

         "Technical answer  \nYes – in SAP S/4HANA Cloud, private edition (or any on-premise system) you can add or change the “Actions” that appear in the eDocument Cockpit / Manage Electronic Documents app even for a completely custom eDocument Process.  The cockpit UI is driven by a pluggable action framework; you only have to register a new Action ID in Customizing and supply the ABAP routine that should run when users press the new button.\n\nMinimum implementation steps  \n1. Create (or identify) your own eDocument process  \n   SPRO → Cross-Application Components → Document and Reporting Compliance → eDocument → Define eDocument Processes  \n   • Z-process code, source document type(s), status profile, etc.\n\n2. Register the custom Action  \n   SPRO → … → Maintain eDocument Types and Actions → New entries  \n   • Action ID (ZSUBMIT, ZRELEASE, …)  \n   • Text shown in the cockpit button  \n   • Allowed source status / target status  \n   • Execution object: either  \n     – Function Module (classic)  ‑OR-  \n     – ABAP OO Class that implements interface /ACR/IF_EDOC_ACTION  \n   • “Display in Cockpit” = X\n\n3. Implement the logic  \n   • If you chose a Function Module, copy the interface of FM /ACR/EDOC_SUBMIT_FM  \n   • If you chose a class, implement /ACR/IF_EDOC_ACTION~EXECUTE  \n   • Typical tasks: read EDOC_HEADER, create / update XML, push to AIF, set new status via /ACR/CL_EDOC_STATUS_UPD=>UPDATE_STATUS.\n\n4. (Optional) expose additional fields or checks  \n   • BAdI /ACR/EDOC_COCKPIT_CFLD to fill or validate custom fields  \n   • Add the fields to CDS view I_EDocumentCockpit and extend the authorisation object /ACR/EDOC.\n\n5. Make the button visible in the Fiori app  \n   Nothing additional is needed if “Display in Cockpit” is ticked; the UI picks up the new Action ID automatically.  \n   If you need special placement, create a UI adaptation project and add the action in extHookGetActions( ).\n\n6. Transport the Z objects to QA/PRD.  All development stays in the customer namespace (no SAP-modifying), which is fully supported in Private Cloud.\n\nTool confirmation  \n• SAP documentation summary explicitly states that “you can extend the eDocument Cockpit with custom fields and actions using BAdIs” (sap_documentation_summary).  \n• SAP Help lookup for “eDocument cockpit custom action” lists the IMG path and the technical artefacts (Action ID, function module/class, interface /ACR/IF_EDOC_ACTION) needed to add a new button.\n\nPlain-language takeaway  \nYou can indeed add your own button (action) in the eDocument Cockpit for a tailor-made compliance scenario; you just register it in SPRO and write the ABAP code that should run when users click it.",

In SAP S/4HANA Public Cloud the two Fiori apps  \n\n• Manage Electronic Documents (App ID F5437)  \n• eDocument Cockpit (App ID F2963)  \n\nare delivered with key-user extensibility.  \nThe only supported way to add your own fields is:\n\n1. Create the field  \n   • Open Fiori app “Custom Fields” (F1481).  \n   • Business Context = “Document Compliance”.  \n   • Define the data type, label, etc., and press Publish.  \n     → The field is automatically:  \n       – Appended to CDS views I_EDOCUMENTEX2 (header) or I_EDOCUMENTITEMEX2 (item).  \n       – Stored in table EDOC_CFD_PR.  \n       – Flagged “Enable Usage in UIs and Reports”, so it becomes selectable in both cockpit UIs.\n\n2. Fill the field at runtime  \n   • Open app “Custom Logic” (F1482).  \n   • Create an implementation of BAdI EDOC_CUSTOM_FIELDS_CLOUD  \n     (optional: EDOC_CUSTOM_FIELDS_UI_CLOUD for on-screen recalculations).  \n   • Filter by the compliance process (e.g. AR_EINVOICE, PEPPOL_INVOICE…).  \n   • Populate the CHANGING structure CS_EDOC_EXTENSION with your values.\n\n   Example snippet\n   ```\n   METHOD edoc_custom_fields.\n     IF iv_process = 'AR_EINVOICE'.\n       SELECT SINGLE vkorg vtweg\n              FROM vbrk\n              INTO @DATA(ls_vbrk)\n              WHERE vbeln = @iv_erp_object_id.\n       cs_edoc_extension-zz_sales_org = ls_vbrk-vkorg.\n       cs_edoc_extension-zz_dist_chan = ls_vbrk-vtweg.\n     ENDIF.\n   ENDMETHOD.\n   ```\n\n3.

         "Technical answer  \nYes. In SAP S/4HANA Cloud, public edition for Spain you can enrich any standard eDocument process (for example FACe, SII, TicketBAI) with your own fields and show them in the “eDocument Cockpit” Fiori app. SAP delivers a key-user extensibility path:\n\n1. Create the field  \n   • Launch Fiori app “Custom Fields” (F1494).  \n   • Business Context: Document Compliance.  \n   • Define data type, label, publish → a YY1_* field is generated and becomes part of CDS view I_EDOC_EXTENSION.\n\n2. Populate the field at runtime  \n   • Open Fiori app “Custom Logic” (F1481) and create an implementation for BAdI EDOC_CUSTOM_FIELDS_CLOUD (optionally also ‑UI).  \n   • Set filter Process = FACE_INV / SII_INV / TBAI_INV … so the code only runs for the Spanish scenario you extend.  \n   • Example ABAP for-cloud snippet:  \n     ```\n     METHOD if_edocument_custom_fields_cloud~fill_custom_fields.\n       DATA ls_ext TYPE yy1_doccompl_ext.          \"your structure\n       ls_ext-yy1_salesorg_sp = bill_doc-sales_org.  \"derive value\n       APPEND ls_ext TO extension_out.\n     ENDMETHOD.\n     ```\n\n3. Expose the field in the Cockpit UI  \n   • Use “Adapt UI” or a personal variant to add the YY1_* column; or handle visibility/formatting in BAdI EDOC_CUSTOM_FIELDS_UI_CLOUD.  \n   • Field values appear automatically once the BAdI fills them, can be filtered and authorised like any other column.\n\n4. Transport  \n   • Extension field + BAdI implementation are collected in a software collection and moved through the Q- and P-systems. No modification key or SAP note is needed.\n\nConstraints / prerequisites  \n• Only key-user BAdIs (no classical SE18).  \n• Works for existing processes delivered by Document & Reporting Compliance; you cannot create an entirely new process in public cloud.  \n• Field is purely informational for the XML; if you need it in the outbound XML mapping you must also adjust the relevant mapping BAdI for that Spanish process.\n\nPlain-language summary  \nYes—you can add your own column to the eDocument Cockpit in SAP S/4HANA Cloud Spain by creating a custom field and a small “Custom Logic” implementation; the field is then filled automatically and visible in the cockpit list.",

Create the new field in SAP S/4HANA Cloud  \n   • App “Custom Fields and Logic” → Create → Business Context “eDocument” (or Billing/Accounting if the data comes from there).  \n   • Choose the data element (e.g. Quantity with Unit).  \n   • Publish. (This places the field into structure EDOC_HDR/EDOC_ITEM-CUSTOM_FIELDS).\n\n2. Expose the field in the eDocument Cockpit UI (optional).  \n   • In the same app choose “UIs & Reports” and tick “eDocument Cockpit”.  \n   • Publish again.  \n   • This only makes the column technically available; content is added in step 4.\n\n3. Start developer extensibility in ADT.  \n   • ADT → File → New → ABAP Cloud Project (system = your SAP S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition tenant).  \n   • Make sure the eDocument proxy objects are released for developer extensibility.\n\n4. Implement BAdI EDOC_CUSTOM_FIELDS_CLOUD.  \n   • ADT → Enhancement Spots → ES_EDOCUMENT_CLOUD → New BAdI Enhancement Implementation.  \n   • Choose BAdI definition EDOC_CUSTOM_FIELDS_CLOUD and method FILL_EDOC_CUSTOM_FIELDS.  \n   • Sample code skeleton:\n\n```abap\nMETHOD if_edoc_custom_fields_cloud~fill_edoc_custom_fields.\n\n* Example: fill total weight copied from billing doc\n  DATA(ls_cust) = VALUE edoc_s_custom_fields( ).\n  ls_cust-yy1_totalweight_edc = is_source_data-billing-weight.\n  rs_custom_fields = ls_cust.\n\nENDMETHOD.\n```\n\n   • `IS_SOURCE_DATA` provides billing, accounting, delivery, etc.; copy the required values into structure `RS_CUSTOM_FIELDS`.\n\n5. (Optional) control the visibility/attributes in the cockpit  \n   • Implement BAdI EDOC_CUSTOM_FIELDS_UI_CLOUD (same enhancement spot).  \n   • Method MODIFY_EDOC_UI_FIELD_ATTR lets you hide, rename, set display-only, etc.\n\n6. Transport & test  \n   • Activate and release the ABAP Cloud transport request.  \n   • Run app “Generate eDocuments” or create a billing document → monitor in “eDocument Cockpit”.  \n   • Your custom column appears and is filled.\n\nResult: the eDocument payload, the EDOC_COCKPIT list, and any subsequent PEPPOL/UBL XML mapping steps now carry the new custom field.\n\nPlain-language summary  \nCreate the field with “Custom Fields”, then in ADT code the BAdI EDOC_CUSTOM_FIELDS_CLOUD to populate it, optionally adjust cockpit visibility, activate, and the extra data travels with every new eDocument.",

         "Technical explanation  \nYes. SAP explicitly supports an “extended-authorization” approach in which you add one or more custom header fields (for example “Sales Organisation” or “Country”) to every eDocument and then run your own authority check before a line is shown in the Manage Electronic Documents / eDocument Cockpit apps.\n\nKey steps confirmed by SAP Help pages  \n1. Create custom header field  \n   • App “Custom Fields and Logic” → Business context “eDocument Header (I_EDOCUMENTHDR)”.  \n   • Publish → field is added to table EDOCUMENT (include) and to OData service API_EDOCUMENT_SRV, so it appears in the list/detail pages of the Cockpit.\n\n2. Fill the field during document creation  \n   • BAdI EDOCUMENT_EXTENSION – copy the organisational value from the source document into structure S_EDOC_HDR-<your field>.  \n   Example (SD billing):  \n   ```\n   METHOD if_edocument_extension~fill_header.\n     DATA(ls_vbrk) = get_vbrk( is_source_doc ).   \"your helper\n     cs_edoc_hdr-org_unit = ls_vbrk-vkorg.\n   ENDMETHOD.\n   ```\n\n3. Enforce the authorisation at run-time  \n   • Customising path: Cross-Application Components → Document and Reporting Compliance → eDocument Cockpit → Authorisations → Define Organisational Units (table EDOC_ORGU).  \n   • BAdI EDOCUMENT_AUTH_CHECK – read the eDocument header, compare the custom field with the user’s authorisation object and raise CX_NO_AUTHORITY when it fails:\n   ```\n   AUTHORITY-CHECK OBJECT  Z_EDOC_ORG\n       ID  ORGID FIELD ls_edoc_hdr-org_unit\n       ID  ACTVT FIELD '03'.\n   IF sy-subrc <> 0.\n     RAISE EXCEPTION TYPE cx_edoc_no_authority.\n   ENDIF.\n   ```\n   • Add the new authorisation object (e.g. Z_EDOC_ORG) with allowed values to the relevant PFCG roles.\n\nEffect  \n• The UI list is filtered automatically: users only see eDocuments for which the BAdI grants authority.  \n• The custom field can also be exposed as a search criterion, giving an additional manual filter.\n\nSource evidence (tool output)  \n• sap_documentation_summary: SAP Help topic “Extend eDocument Cockpit with Custom Fields and Enhanced Authorization” – describes adding organisational-unit field and “additional authorization checks based on organisational units” to limit visibility.  \n• sap_help_lookup: detailed SAP Help steps for “Extension of eDocument Cockpit with Custom Fields and Enhanced Authorization”, including the same BAdIs and Customising path.\n\nPlain-language answer  \nYes—by adding your own field (e.g., company code or sales org) to each eDocument and plugging your own authority check via the standard BAdIs, you can make the cockpit show only the documents that a user is allowed to see.",

         "Technical answer  \nYes. SAP delivers a standard, customer-configurable authorization restriction called “Electronic Document: Restriction for Organizational Unit” that lets you limit which eDocuments a user can see in both:  \n• Fiori app “Manage Electronic Documents” (tile ID: EDOC_COCKPIT)  \n• SAP GUI/OP cockpit EDOC_COCKPIT\n\nHow to set it up (no coding required)  \n1. Open Fiori app “Business Catalogs”.  \n   • Locate catalog SAP_SD_BC_GLO_EDOC_PC (Globalization – Electronic Documents).  \n2. Note the business roles that already use this catalog (e.g. SAP_BR_BILLING_CLERK).  \n3. Launch “Maintain Business Roles”.  \n4. Select the role to be restricted → Edit → Maintain Restrictions.  \n5. In tab “Read, Value Help”, scroll to “Electronic Document: Restriction for Organizational Unit”.  \n6. For each eDocument process (OUTBOUND_INV, EDOC_SD, etc.) choose:  \n   – Field to restrict on (Company Code, Sales Organization, Plant, …).  \n   – Allowed value(s) or ranges.  \n7. Save (and Publish, if required).\n\nResult  \nWhen the user starts the cockpit, the framework injects the selected org-unit filter into the OData service (API_EDOC_COCKPIT_SRV). Only documents whose header fields match the maintained values are displayed; all others stay hidden.\n\nKey points  \n• Works for every eDocument process delivered by Document & Reporting Compliance.  \n• No need to create custom authorization objects or BADIs; the restriction is part of the SAP IAM framework.  \n• If left blank, the user sees all documents (default behavior).  \n• The same steps apply in on-premise PFCG roles via the Fiori “Maintain Restrictions” screen.\n\nExample  \nRole Z_BILLING_WEST  \nRestriction table entry:  \nProcess = OUTBOUND_INV | Field = Sales Org | Values = 1000, 1200  \n→ Users with role Z_BILLING_WEST will only see outbound invoice eDocuments created for sales orgs 1000 or 1200.\n\nPlain-language summary  \nYes—by maintaining the delivered “Electronic Document: Restriction for Organizational Unit” in your business roles, you can let each user see only the eDocuments that belong to the company code, sales org, or other org unit you specify.",

         "Technical explanation  \nYes. In SAP S/4HANA Cloud, public edition (Germany) you can suppress the automatic creation of an eDocument whenever your own business criteria are met.  \nThe framework calls the BAdI EDOC_ADAPTOR_CLOUD before an entry is written to the eDocument tables that feed both Fiori apps (“Manage Electronic Documents” and the “eDocument Cockpit”).  \nInside its method IF_EDOC_ADAPTOR_CLOUD~IS_RELEVANT you can set the changing parameter CV_RELEVANT to abap_false, and no eDocument is created or shown in either app.\n\nKey facts confirmed by SAP documentation & code search  \n• SAP Help (Public Cloud) – “how to prevent creation of electronic documents for zero-value invoices”: the recommended way is to implement EDOC_ADAPTOR_CLOUD->IS_RELEVANT and return FALSE.  \n• Codebase examples (ABAP search): many country adaptors implement the same pattern – logic checks the source data, and if the condition fails it sets CV_RELEVANT = ABAP_FALSE and exits.  \n  Example snippet from CL_EDOC_ADAPTOR_MX_SD_FICA:  \n  ```\n  METHOD if_edoc_adaptor_cloud~is_relevant.\n    IF <your condition>.\n       cv_relevant = abap_false.      \"skip eDoc creation\n    ENDIF.\n  ENDMETHOD.\n  ```\n\nHow to implement in Public Cloud  \n1. In Fiori “Custom Logic” app (or ABAP Cloud in ADT) create an enhancement implementation for BAdI EDOC_ADAPTOR_CLOUD.  \n2. Code method IS_RELEVANT, for example:  \n   ```\n   METHOD if_edoc_adaptor_cloud~is_relevant.\n     DATA ls_bill TYPE edoc_src_data_sd_invoice.      \"example for SD invoices\n     IF io_source->mv_source_type = 'SD_INVOICE'.\n       io_source->get_data( IMPORTING es_data = ls_bill ).\n       \"sample rule: skip invoices with net value = 0\n       IF ls_bill-billing_header-netwr = 0.\n         cv_relevant = abap_false.\n       ENDIF.\n     ENDIF.\n   ENDMETHOD.\n   ```  \n3. Activate and transport.  \n4. Post a document that meets your rule → no row appears in Manage Electronic Documents or eDocument Cockpit; other documents behave as usual.\n\nPoints to remember  \n• This is the only supported way to “restrict” creation in Public Cloud; there is no checkbox or SSCUI for it.  \n• The BAdI runs for all countries—wrap your logic in IF cl_edocument_utilities=>get_country( ) = ‘DE’.  \n• Make sure the suppression is legally acceptable; German tax authorities may require complete archives.  \n• The rule acts at creation time; it does not hide or delete eDocuments that already exist.\n\nPlain-language answer  \nYes—by adding simple custom ABAP logic to the delivered BAdI EDOC_ADAPTOR_CLOUD you can tell the system “don’t create an eDocument” when your own conditions (e.g. zero-value invoice, specific document type, etc.) are met, so nothing appears in either eDocument Fiori app.",

Create a new enhancement-spot implementation  \n   Enhancement spot: ES_EDOCUMENT_CLOUD\n\n2. Implement BAdI EDOC_ADAPTOR_CLOUD  \n   a. In ADT choose File ➔ New ➔ ABAP Class (e.g. ZCL_EDOC_ADAPTOR_BLOCK)  \n   b. Add interface IF_EDOC_ADAPTOR_CLOUD (ADT inserts all required methods).  \n\n3. Optional: maintain a filter value  \n   • Field GENERIC_FILTER can hold “ES_BLOCK” (or any string).  \n   • If you plan different rules per country/source type you can later steer which filter value is used in method CHANGE_ADAPTOR_GENERIC_FILTER of the source-type extension class.\n\n4. Code your relevance check  \n   In method IF_EDOC_ADAPTOR_CLOUD~CHECK_RELEVANCE place, for example:\n\n   ```\n   \"Simple example: block all Spanish billing documents\n   rv_is_relevant = abap_false.       \" system will NOT create an eDocument\n   ```\n\n   – Return ABAP_FALSE to suppress creation.  \n   – Add any business logic you like (e.g. allow only invoices above 400 EUR).\n\n5. Activate class and create the BAdI implementation  \n   ADT ➔ New ➔ BAdI Implementation, choose EDOC_ADAPTOR_CLOUD, assign the class, maintain the same filter value (if used). No SSCUI or IMG activity is necessary.\n\n6. Transport / release as usual.\n\n7. Test  \n   – Post a Spanish billing document (or whatever source document you targeted).  \n   – Check Manage Electronic Documents or EDOC_COCKPIT: no new entry should be created.  \n   – Remove or adjust your logic and repeat to verify the behaviour.\n\nKey SAP objects referenced (from help output)  \n• Enhancement Spot ES_EDOCUMENT_CLOUD  \n• BAdI Definition EDOC_ADAPTOR_CLOUD  \n• Interface IF_EDOC_ADAPTOR_CLOUD  \n• Framework class CL_EDOCUMENT_CLOUD (calls the BAdI)  \n\nPlain-language summary  \nCreate one small BAdI implementation (EDOC_ADAPTOR_CLOUD) and in its CHECK_RELEVANCE method return “false” for the documents you want to block; after activation those documents will never reach the eDocument apps.",

         "Technical answer  \nYes – in SAP S/4HANA Cloud, Public Edition you can programmatically change the UBL-TR XML that the Turkish e-Invoice solution sends to the TRA/GİB. Two extensibility options exist:\n\n1. Key-user BAdIs (Custom Logic app) – country-specific  \n   • BADI_EDOC_TR_INVOICE_CHANGE  – change / add header tags  \n   • BADI_EDOC_TR_INVOICE_LINE_CHG – change / add line tags  \n   These BAdIs are offered in the business context “eDocument: Turkey Document Compliance” and are implemented directly in the Fiori app “Custom Logic”. No ADT is required.\n\n2. Developer BAdI (ADT) – global, works for every country  \n   • BAdI name: EDOC_ADAPTOR_CLOUD (enhancement spot ES_EDOCUMENT_CLOUD)  \n   • Implemented only with Developer Extensibility in ABAP Development Tools.  \n   • Key method for XML manipulation: IF_BADI_EDOC_ADAPTOR_CLOUD~ADJUST_XML_MAPPING (or the older alias SET_OUTPUT_DATA).  \n   • You create an “Enhancement Implementation” class in ADT, code your changes on the XML DOM, activate, and the framework merges your additions before the file is handed over to the integration flow.\n\nExample (ADT implementation of EDOC_ADAPTOR_CLOUD):\n\n```abap\nMETHOD if_badi_edoc_adaptor_cloud~adjust_xml_mapping.\n  DATA lr_root TYPE REF TO if_sxml_element.\n\n  \"Get the root of the current XML document\n  lr_root = io_xml->get_root( ).\n\n  \"Add customer material number\n  lr_root->append_child(\n    cl_sxml_factory=>create_simple_element(\n      name  = 'cbc:BuyerItemIdentification'\n      value = is_header-cust_matnr )   ).\n\n  \"Add delivery number into <AdditionalDocumentReference>\n  IF is_header-vbeln IS NOT INITIAL.\n    DATA(lr_docref) = cl_sxml_factory=>create_simple_element( name = 'cac:AdditionalDocumentReference' ).\n    lr_docref->append_child( cl_sxml_factory=>create_simple_element(\n                               name  = 'cbc:ID'\n                               value = is_header-vbeln ) ).\n    lr_root->append_child( lr_docref ).\n  ENDIF.\nENDMETHOD.\n```\n\nAfter activation, test the result in the Manage Electronic Documents / EDOC_COCKPIT app; the new nodes appear in the XML preview and are forwarded to the service provider.\n\nImportant prerequisites / limits\n• For option 2 you must have Developer Extensibility enabled in your public-cloud tenant and the user must hold a “Developer” role.  \n• Both options run only at XML build time; once the document has status “Sent” you cannot modify it.  \n• Keep to TRA/GİB schema rules—adding illegal tags leads to validation errors.  \n• Transport of the ADT enhancement follows the standard cloud software-component branch (no manual import needed).\n\nPlain-language summary  \nYes – you can still tweak the Turkish e-Invoice XML in S/4HANA Public Cloud: either with key-user logic (Custom Logic app) or, if you prefer ADT coding, by implementing BAdI EDOC_ADAPTOR_CLOUD, which lets you add or change XML elements just before the file is sent.",

         "Technical explanation  \n1. SAP delivers the e-mail that is sent when you press Customer (or Supplier) in Fiori app “Manage Electronic Documents” (F4306) through the enhancement spot ES_EDOCUMENT_CLOUD.  \n2. Inside this spot the BAdI EDOC_PART_CONN_CHANGE_EMAIL_V2 (interface IF_EDOC_PART_CONN_CHANGE_EMAIL_V2) is raised immediately before the e-mail is handed over to CL_BCS for sending.  \n3. By creating your own implementation of this BAdI you can:  \n   • change FROM/TO/CC/BCC addresses,  \n   • overwrite the subject, plain-text body or HTML body,  \n   • inspect / replace the default PDF attachment,  \n   • add further attachments such as the XML, extra PDFs, T&Cs, etc.  \n4. Two implementation options exist in SAP S/4HANA Cloud, public edition:  \n   a) Key-user (In-App) – Fiori app “Custom Logic” ➜ Create ➜ Extension Point ➜ EDOC_PART_CONN_CHANGE_EMAIL_V2. Activate; no transport needed.  \n   b) Developer (Eclipse/ADT) – Create a class that implements the BAdI in enhancement spot ES_EDOCUMENT_CLOUD; transport like any other ABAP Cloud artifact.  \n5. Typical code pattern (simplified):\n\n```\nMETHOD if_edoc_part_conn_change_email_v2~change_email.\n  \"Recipents\n  cs_email_data-to      = 'customer@demo.com'.\n  cs_email_data-cc      = 'sales@myco.com'.\n\n  \"Subject / HTML body\n  cs_email_data-subject = |Invoice { cs_context-sd_doc }|.\n  cs_email_data-body_htm =\n    |<p>Dear { cs_context-bp_name },<br/>|\n    |Please find your eInvoice attached.</p>|.\n\n  \"Replace the default PDF and attach XML\n  LOOP AT ct_attachments INTO DATA(ls_att).\n    IF ls_att-file_name CP '*.pdf'.\n      ls_att-content = lv_new_brand_pdf_xstring.\n      MODIFY ct_attachments FROM ls_att.\n    ENDIF.\n  ENDLOOP.\n\n  DATA(ls_xml) = VALUE edoc_s_email_attachment(\n                    file_name = |{ cs_context-interface_guid }.xml|\n                    mime_type = 'application/xml'\n                    content   = lv_xml_xstring ).\n  APPEND ls_xml TO ct_attachments.\nENDMETHOD.\n```\n\n6. Nothing else in the standard process must be altered; once your implementation is active every “Send to Customer” action uses the enhanced template.\n\nPlain-language takeaway  \nCreate a Custom-Logic/ABAP implementation of BAdI EDOC_PART_CONN_CHANGE_EMAIL_V2 and you can freely tailor the e-mail (recipients, text, and attachments) that Germany customer invoices send from the Manage Electronic Documents app.",

Add the specific BAdI  \n   • In the wizard choose “Add BAdI Implementation”  \n   • Select EDOC_PART_CONN_CHANGE_EMAIL_V2 (description: “Change e-mail to customer V2”)  \n   • Provide a short BAdI implementation name (e.g. Z_EDOC_EMAIL_V2).\n\n3. Generate the implementation class  \n   • Press “Implementing Class” → accept the proposed Z-class name.  \n   • ADT creates the class and automatically adds interface IF_EDOC_CHANGE_EMAIL_V2.\n\n4. Code the logic in method CHANGE_EMAIL_TO_CUSTOMER  \n   • Open the class, double-click the method → ADT shows signature:\n\n     METHOD if_edoc_change_email_v2~change_email_to_customer.  \n       \"IMPORTING  \n       \"  is_sender          TYPE srt_addr_mail  \n       \"  is_recipient       TYPE srt_addr_mail  \n       \"  is_edocument       TYPE edoc_header_s  \n       \"CHANGING  \n       \"  cs_email_header    TYPE edoc_email_header_s  \n       \"  ct_email_body      TYPE edoc_t_email_body  \n       \"  ct_attachments     TYPE edoc_t_attachment  \n     ENDMETHOD.\n\n   • Typical adjustments:  \n     – Change sender/recipient address or display name in cs_email_header  \n     – Overwrite subject:  cs_email_header-subject = |Invoice { is_edocument-ref_docno }|.  \n     – Append extra line to body:  APPEND VALUE #( line = `Thank you for your business.` ) TO ct_email_body.  \n     – Add PDF from your own repository to ct_attachments.\n\n5. Activate and transport  \n   • Activate class and implementation.  \n   • Assign to a transport request if prompted.  \n   • No customizing step is needed; an active Cloud BAdI implementation is used automatically when the eDocument partner connector sends e-mails.\n\nKey points / limitations  \n• Runs only in the Communication Layer of Document and Reporting Compliance; it is tenant-specific.  \n• One active implementation per client is taken (filter values not offered).  \n• Supported objects today: Germany invoice XML, Poland KSeF, Saudi ZATCA, Thailand eTax/eReceipt, etc.  \n• Keep performance low—method is called for every outbound e-mail.  \n• Do not use synchronous RFCs, authority checks, or GUI calls inside your code.\n\nPlain-language takeaway  \n“In Eclipse you just create a new enhancement for spot ES_EDOCUMENT_CLOUD, pick the BAdI EDOC_PART_CONN_CHANGE_EMAIL_V2, let ADT generate the class, and write your code in the single method to adjust subject, body, or attachments of every DRC outbound e-mail—activate and you’re done.”",

         "Technical explanation\n• SAP S/4HANA Cloud, public edition uses Output Management for every e-mail that leaves the system.  \n• Each output item automatically contains the rendered form (PDF/XML).  \n• Extra files can be added if – and only if – they are supplied to the framework in one of two supported ways:  \n  1. Business-object attachment marked as “Relevant for Output”  \n     – Fiori configuration step “Define Output Settings for Document Types” lets a key user flag an attachment category (e.g. “TECHDRAW”) as Relevant and, if desired, “Merge with Form Template”.  \n     – At runtime the framework picks up all flagged attachments and sends them together with the form.  \n  2. Key-user BAdI logic  \n     – BAdI EDOC_PART_CONN_CHANGE_EMAIL (class CL_EDC_PART_CONN_CHANGE_EMAIL, see code extract in tool result) exposes table parameters emailattachments[].  \n     – By filling this table in custom logic you can programmatically inject any binary content (MIME type + filename + xstring) before the e-mail is dispatched.\n\nConstraints\n• Function is available only in the Cloud extensibility scope (key-user BAdI or attachment handling); there is no UI to add files ad-hoc when the mail is already “In Preparation”.  \n• Maximum outbound mail size in public cloud is 25 MB (body + all attachments).  \n• Supported MIME types: any except text/uri-list; most common types (PDF, XML, ZIP, JPEG, etc.) are accepted.  \n• The rendered form itself cannot be suppressed; at least one attachment (the form) is always present.\n\nAnswer\nYes – in SAP S/4HANA Cloud, public edition you can add additional files to the e-mail that is sent to customers, provided you either (a) store the file as an attachment to the business object and mark it “relevant for output”, or (b) supply it through the released key-user BAdI that lets you fill the email-attachments table before dispatch. There is no option to attach files manually after the output item was created.\n\nPlain-language summary\nYou can send extra documents with customer e-mails in the public cloud, but you must add them up-front (as business-object attachments or through custom logic) because the system does not offer a manual “attach file” button at send time.",

         "Technical walkthrough – creating a brand-new Electronic Document (eDocument) process in SAP S/4HANA Public Cloud (Electronic Document Processing framework)\n\n1. Analyse & plan  \n   • Identify the new legal/business requirement (country, document type, submission channel).  \n   • Decide whether you need a completely new process key or only a source-type extension; below focuses on a brand-new process.\n\n2. Create the data layer (ADT)  \n   • Define a transparent table ZEDO<COUNTRY><…> with key EDOC_GUID to hold process-specific data.  \n   • Add any custom fields that must be persisted (reference numbers, external status, etc.).\n\n3. Register the process meta-data (Fiori app “Manage eDocument Process”)  \n   a. Define Process header: PROCESS + VERSION.  \n   b. Maintain Step catalogue – e.g.  \n      REQ_SEND → TRIGG_SEND → SAVE_REQU → PROC_RESP …  \n   c. For every step maintain:  \n      – Step versions & variants  \n      – Result catalogue (OK, ERROR, TIMEOUT …)  \n      – Status flag name/position and mapping to results  \n   d. Define Actions (e.g. SUBMIT) and assign the sequence of steps.  \n   e. Maintain Interface ID determination per step (points to the outbound proxy you will call).\n\n4. Implement ABAP enhancements (cloud-released APIs, done in ADT)  \n   • Create country/region handler class ZCL_EDOC_<CNTRY>_HANDLER implementing IF_EDOCUMENT_HANDLER.  \n   • Implement/override methods such as:  \n     – CHECK_RELEVANCE → decide if a posted FI/SD doc triggers the new process.  \n     – MAP_XML_DATA   → fill legal XML structure.  \n     – PROCESS_<STEP> → coding for each custom step (e.g. call web-service, interpret response).  \n   • Implement BAdI EDOCUMENT_BASE_EXT (filter = new PROCESS) to supply:  \n     – Process name, data table, cockpit icon, submit action, etc.  \n   • If you need generic filter mapping, implement BAdI EDOC_ADAPTOR_CLOUD.  \n   • For web-service/SOAP or Peppol calls:  \n     – Generate a Service Consumption Model, create outbound service, and implement BAdI EDOCUMENT_INT_CONN_EXT for the runtime call.\n\n5. Configure runtime links (SSCUI / SPRO)  \n   • Activate “Source Document Types for Company Code”.  \n   • Assign eDocument Types ↔ Business Object Types.  \n   • Register your new handler class in SSCUI “Register Handling Classes for Source Extension”.  \n   • If you create your own eDocument type, maintain table EDOC_TYPE and map it to the Z-table created in step 2.  \n   • Optional: maintain e-mail sender/receiver addresses if you add a SEND_MAIL step.\n\n6. Test end-to-end  \n   • Post an FI/SD invoice in the Q-system.  \n   • Verify automatic creation in “Manage Electronic Documents” (Fiori) or EDOC_COCKPIT.  \n   • Trigger Action SUBMIT, watch step/result progression and status flags.  \n   • Inspect generated XML via Display XML function.  \n   • Validate response from tax authority / Peppol network.  \n   • Repeat in P-system after transport/import.\n\n7. Govern & operate  \n   • Provide key users with authorization for cockpit apps.  \n   • Set up monitoring alerts for failed steps (status ERROR/TIMEOUT).  \n   • Restrict cancellation of source documents if mandated (config flag in process meta-data).\n\nShort code snippet (MAP_XML_DATA skeleton)\n\nCLASS zcl_edoc_fr_handler IMPLEMENTATION.\n  METHOD if_edocument_handler~map_xml_data.\n    \"Fill UBL Invoice XML proxy structure\n    data: ls_xml TYPE edo_ubl_standard_business_doc2.\n    ls_xml-invoice-id = is_source_data-belnr.\n    ls_xml-issue-date = sy-datum.\n    \"… more mapping …\n    edocument_xml = ls_xml.\n  ENDMETHOD.\nENDCLASS.\n\nPlain-language summary  \nCreate a new eDocument process by defining the process and its steps in the Fiori “Manage eDocument Process” app, building released ABAP handler classes and BAdI implementations for relevance, mapping, and communication, registering those classes in SSCUIs, and finally testing the full flow in the cockpit—all achievable with cloud-compliant tools in SAP S/4HANA Public Cloud.",

         "Technical explanation\nThe e-mail that SAP Document & Reporting Compliance (eDocument Framework) sends to the customer is created centrally in class CL_EDOC_UTIL=>SEND_EMAIL… and is opened for extensions by BAdI EDOC_PART_CONN_CHANGE_EMAIL_V2 (enhancement spot ES_EDOCUMENT_CLOUD).  \nInside this BAdI you receive the current mail header/body and an internal table ATTACHMENTS that the framework later forwards to CL_BCS.  \nBy simply adding a new line to ATTACHMENTS you can ship any additional file – e.g. a self-generated PDF.\n\nMinimal implementation skeleton\n\n```abap\nCLASS zcl_badi_edoc_email_impl\n  IMPLEMENTATION.\n  METHOD if_edoc_part_conn_change_email_v2~get_email_changes.\n\n    \"----- Your own PDF creation or retrieval -------------------\n    DATA lv_pdf TYPE xstring.                             \"binary PDF\n    lv_pdf = zcl_my_pdf_factory=>create_pdf( iv_edoc_guid = edocument-edoc_guid ).\n    IF lv_pdf IS INITIAL.\n      RETURN.                                             \"nothing to add\n    ENDIF.\n\n    \"----- Fill one line of the ATTACHMENTS table -------------\n    DATA ls_att TYPE edoc_email_attachment.\n\n    ls_att-attachm_type    = 'PDF'.                       \"file type\n    ls_att-attachm_subject = |Extra_Info_{ sy-datum }.pdf|.\"shown name\n    ls_att-content_hex     = cl_document_bcs=>xstring_to_solix( lv_pdf ).\n    ls_att-attachm_size    = xstrlen( lv_pdf ).           \"size in bytes\n*   Optional header / language etc.:\n*   ls_att-attachm_header  = VALUE #( ( line = 'Content-Disposition: attachment' ) ).\n*   ls_att-attachm_language = sy-langu.\n\n    APPEND ls_att TO attachments.                         \"← this is the BAdI CHANGING table\n\n  ENDMETHOD.\nENDCLASS.\n```\n\nHow it works\n1. The framework calls **IF_EDOC_PART_CONN_CHANGE_EMAIL_V2~GET_EMAIL_CHANGES** directly before CL_BCS is invoked (see method listings such as CL_EDOCUMENT_PE→SEND_EMAIL_TO_VENDOR in the standard code).\n2. Whatever you append to parameter ATTACHMENTS is copied one-to-one to CL_DOCUMENT_BCS→ADD_ATTACHMENT (fields match exactly):\n   • ATTACHM_TYPE → I_ATTACHMENT_TYPE (‘PDF’, ‘XML’, …)  \n   • ATTACHM_SUBJECT → I_ATTACHMENT_SUBJECT  \n   • CONTENT_HEX / CONTENT_TEXT → I_ATT_CONTENT_HEX / I_ATT_CONTENT_TEXT  \n   • ATTACHM_SIZE → I_ATTACHMENT_SIZE\n3. No further configuration is required; as soon as the BAdI is active the extra PDF travels with every outgoing e-mail built by the eDocument framework for the selected source type(s).\n\nTiny helper to turn an XSTRING into SOLIX (already used above):\n\n```abap\nls_att-content_hex = cl_document_bcs=>xstring_to_solix( lv_pdf ).\n```\n\nIf you need an example of generating the PDF itself, you can reuse the pattern shown in standard class CL_EDOC_UTIL_HU_INV→GET_EMAIL_PDF:\n\n```abap\nDATA lo_pdf TYPE REF TO cl_edocument_pdf_my.\nCREATE OBJECT lo_pdf EXPORTING is_edocument = edocument.\nlv_pdf = lo_pdf->create_pdf( iv_file_type = 'REQUEST'\n                             iv_file_raw  = lv_xml_stream ).\n```\n\nPlain-language summary  \nCreate a BAdI implementation for EDOC_PART_CONN_CHANGE_EMAIL_V2, build or read the PDF as an XSTRING, convert it to SOLIX, put it into a new row of the ATTACHMENTS parameter, and the framework will automatically send the extra PDF together with the original invoice mail.",

         "Technical explanation (derived strictly from SAP-Help and SAP-DRC documentation)\n\n1. Get the service metadata  \n   • SAP delivers a WSDL for every DRC process (for example “eInvoice SK” → file SK_E_INVO.wsdl).  \n   • Download it from the SAP Help page of the corresponding country process.\n\n2. Generate the consumer proxy (Service Consumption Model) in ABAP Development Tools  \n   ADT → New → ABAP Repository Object → Business Services → Service Consumption Model  \n     – Point to the WSDL you downloaded.  \n     – Remote Consumption Mode = “Web Service”.  \n     – Choose a name / package / transport.  \n   Result: a proxy class ZCO_… (or ZSC_…) plus the DDIC request/response types that DRC will call.\n\n3. Create an Outbound Service that wraps the proxy  \n   ADT → New → ABAP Repository Object → Cloud Communication Management → Outbound Service  \n     – Service Type = “SOAP”  \n     – Service Interface = the proxy class from step 2.\n\n4. Add the Outbound Service to a Communication Scenario and publish it  \n   • Either extend an existing DRC scenario or create a new one.  \n   • After publishing, the administrator can create the standard Public-Cloud artefacts:  \n       – Communication System  \n       – Communication Arrangement (via Fiori apps).  \n   • Authentication in the arrangement (OAuth 2.0, SSL-client certificate, user/password) must match what you will enter in the DRC cloud edition.\n\n5. Retrieve the runtime destination in ABAP (no SOAMANAGER in Public Cloud)  \n   DATA(soap_dest) = cl_soap_destination_provider=>create_by_comm_arrangement(\n                       comm_scenario  = ‘<SCENARIO_ID>’\n                       service_id     = ‘<OUTBOUND_SERVICE_ID>’ ).\n\n6. Call the proxy in your new DRC process implementation  \n   DATA(proxy) = NEW zco_<proxy_class>( destination = soap_dest ).  \n   proxy-><operation>( EXPORTING input = request IMPORTING output = response ).  \n\n   Optional helper protocols (all via CL_WS_PROTOCOL_FACTORY):  \n     – SOAP header insertion (custom DRC header XML)  \n     – EOIO sequence handling  \n     – HTTP header fields (e.g. Application-Interface-Key).\n\n7. Runtime security check  \n   • If the Communication Arrangement uses an SSL-client certificate, make sure the same certificate is uploaded in STRUST (SSL Client PSE).  \n   • For OAuth 2.0 choose grant-type “Client Credentials”, supply client-id/client-secret and copy the token-endpoint from DRC.\n\n8. Monitoring / troubleshooting  \n   • Fiori “Communication Monitoring” shows outbound calls.  \n   • STAD or ABAP Runtime Error tools for deep traces.  \n   • Service-specific fault class ZSC_CX_… generated together with the proxy.\n\n(For on-premise or private-cloud customers the same proxy would be activated via SOAMANAGER → Web Service Configuration → search for the delivered proxy → “Create Logical Port” → set Consumer-Security. That SOAMANAGER part is not available in Public Cloud and therefore replaced by steps 3–5 above.)\n\nPlain-language takeaway  \n“In Public-Cloud you do not touch SOAMANAGER; you create a Service Consumption Model from the DRC WSDL, wrap it in an Outbound Service, expose it through a Communication Scenario, and let the Communication Arrangement provide the runtime destination that your ABAP code (the new DRC process) uses.”\n\nMini example\n\n*Proxy call with custom DRC SOAP header*\n\nDATA(request) = VALUE zsc_req_msg_type( … ).\nDATA(soap_dest) = cl_soap_destination_provider=>create_by_comm_arrangement(\n                    comm_scenario = 'Z_DRC_CSC' service_id = 'Z_OUT_DRC_1' ).\n\nDATA(proxy)  = NEW zco_sk_e_invoice( destination = soap_dest ).\n\nDATA(header) = cl_ws_protocol_factory=>get_soap_header_protocol( proxy ).\nheader->add_soap_header_element( |<n0:DRC_Header country=\"SK\" version=\"1.0\"/>| ).\n\nproxy->submit_invoice( EXPORTING input = request\n                       IMPORTING output = DATA(response) ).\n\nThis sequence is all that is required to register a new proxy web-service for a DRC process in SAP S/4HANA Public Cloud.",

Create the interface itself  \n   SPRO → Cross-Application Components → Document & Reporting Compliance → Framework Settings → Communication Management  \n   Activity : “Define Interface Type for eDocument”  \n   • Copy an SAP entry or create a new one.  \n     – Interface ID (e.g. Z_MYINTF)  \n     – Direction = Outbound / Inbound as required  \n     – Runtime Class = CL_EDOC_CLD_CONNECTOR (generic DRC cloud connector)  \n     – Version, XML/EDI indicator, etc.  \n   (Table EDOC_INTFT is filled.)\n\n2. Link the interface to your custom process  \n   Activity : “Define Process Communication Through Cloud Services”  \n   • Enter your custom process key (e.g. ZMYPROC) in column “Process”.  \n   • Assign the interface ID from step 1.  \n   • Maintain SAP BTP service instance, OAuth client, target URL that the external platform exposes.  \n   (Tables EDOC_CLOUD_COM / EDOC_CLOUD_COMT are filled.)\n\n3. Expose the interface to “Public” recipients  \n   Activity / Fiori app : “Maintain Public Registered Entities for eInvoicing – <country>” (app F5752)  \n   • Press “Create”.  \n   • Country / Region  \n   • Public Entity ID (tax-authority identifier, Peppol participant ID, etc.)  \n   • Communication Interface = Z_MYINTF (value help comes from step 1)  \n   • Save.  \n   (Country-specific table EDOC_PUB_ENT_XX is updated.)\n\n4.

         "Technical explanation (step–by-step)\n\n1. Prerequisites  \n   • Your S/4HANA Cloud tenant must have the “Document and Reporting Compliance” licence and a subscription to SAP Integration Suite.  \n   • Developer extensibility (ADT in the 3-system landscape) must be enabled.  \n   • The Italian country package is already active; therefore Italian legal checks (CUP/CIG, SDI/Peppol channel, etc.) are available for reuse.\n\n2. Register the new Process (no coding yet) – Fiori app “Manage eDocument Process”  \n   a. Create Process: give it a four-character name, e.g. ITZ1 (IT = country, Z = custom, 1 = running number).  \n   b. Maintain at least these objects in the same app:  \n      – Process Steps (CREATE, SEND, POLL, EMPTY…)  \n      – Step Versions & Variants (define which method is called)  \n      – Step Results (OK / ERROR)  \n      – Status Flags 01-40 and the Status Determination matrix  \n      – Toolbar Actions and their sequence  \n   c. Save & transport; the framework now “knows” a skeleton of your new flow.\n\n3. Provide the ABAP implementation classes – ADT (Eclipse)  \n   • Country handler (one per country): ZCL_EDOC_IT_HANDLER  ➔ subclass of CL_EDOC_HANDLER_EXT.  \n   • Process class that performs every step you configured: ZCL_EDOC_ITZ1  ➔ implement IF_EDOC_PROCESS_EXT.  \n   • Mapping / integration class: ZCL_EDOC_MAP_ITZ1  ➔ build XML/JSON and call the external SDI/Peppol web service.  \n   • Optional: custom persistence table (e.g. ZEDOITZ1) for Italian Track-ID returned by SDI.\n\n   All three class types are explicitly listed in SAP Help Lookup result (“Creating a Completely New eDocument Process” > “ABAP artefacts for a new process”).\n\n4. Plug your classes into the framework  \n   SSCUI “Register Handling Classes for Source Extension”  \n      – Source Type = (e.g.) SD_INV  \n      – Process = ITZ1  \n      – Source Extension Class = ZCL_EDOC_EXT_SD_INV  \n   SSCUI “Activating Additional eDocument Instance Creation”  \n      – Country = IT  \n      – Factory Class = CL_EDOC_FACTORY_EXT (delivered)  \n\n5. Extend the Italian checks only if needed  \n   • CUP/CIG validation: implement BAdI EDOC_ADAPTOR_CLOUD → method CHECK_DOCUMENT; raise an error when CUP/CIG missing.  \n   • Custom fields in cockpit: use BAdI EDOC_CUSTOM_FIELDS_UI_CLOUD.\n\n6. Create the outbound interface to SDI/Peppol  \n   • ADT wizard “Service Consumption Model” → import the SDI WSDL.  \n   • In ZCL_EDOC_MAP_ITZ1 implement CALL_PROXY( ) and bind via cl_soap_destination_provider=>create_by_comm_arrangement( ).  \n   • Maintain Communication Scenario & Arrangement in Fiori “Communication Arrangements”.\n\n7. Regression tests  \n   • Post a sales invoice; framework calls the hook, creates an eDocument with Process = ITZ1.  \n   • App “Manage Electronic Documents” shows your toolbar; run through CREATE → SEND → POLL steps.  \n   • Check that statuses defined in step 2 appear correctly.\n\n8. Transport to P and enable for business users  \n   • Move customizing and classes via export requests.  \n   • Assign authorization object EDOC_PROC with value ITZ1 to the relevant roles.  \n   • Inform the customer to start using cockpit tile “Manage Electronic Documents”.\n\nPlain-language summary  \n“Create the process in the Fiori ‘Manage eDocument Process’ app, build three small ABAP classes (handler, process, mapping) in Eclipse, register those classes in two SSCUIs, set up the SDI web-service connection, and test the flow from the eDocument cockpit. Once transported, the Italian customer can use the new process exactly like any SAP-delivered scenario.”\n\nQuick snippet (ADT template)\n\nCLASS zcl_edoc_itz1 DEFINITION\n  PUBLIC\n  FINAL\n  CREATE PUBLIC .\n\n  PUBLIC SECTION.\n    INTERFACES if_edoc_process_ext.\nENDCLASS.\n\nCLASS zcl_edoc_itz1 IMPLEMENTATION.\n  METHOD if_edoc_process_ext~execute_step.\n    CASE is_step-step.\n      WHEN 'CREATE'.      \"build header\n      WHEN 'SEND'.        zcl_edoc_map_itz1=>call_proxy( io_edoc ).\n      WHEN 'POLL'.        \"check SDI status …\n    ENDCASE.\n  ENDMETHOD.\nENDCLASS.\n\nAll steps above are explicitly covered by the two SAP documentation extracts returned by the tools; no conflicting information was found.",

         "Technical explanation  \n• S/4HANA Cloud, public edition (where Document & Reporting Compliance runs) does not let you create classical Z-tables with SE11.  \n• Persistency that behaves “like a table” must instead be delivered through the published cloud-extensibility artefacts:  \n  – Configuration/SSCUI activities (ODN, interface types, value mappings, etc.) → data is saved in SAP-delivered EDOC_* or TFK* customizing tables.  \n  – Value-mapping sets maintained with the Fiori app “Manage Value Mappings” → entries are stored in EDOC_VM_* tables.  \n  – Custom Business Objects (app F2773) or released CDS-view extensions (app F3065) → the system generates YY1_* tables for you; they are the supported way to hold any additional lookup or mapping data you need at runtime.  \n• The DRC runtime can read those tables through the released BAdIs (e.g. IF_EDOCUMENT_EXT_ES, BADI_SD_BD_ODN_MODIFY, NFE_CLOUD_EXTENSIBILITY). Example snippet:\n\n  METHOD if_edocument_ext_es~map_data.\n    SELECT * FROM yy1_cntry_map INTO TABLE @lt_map\n      WHERE cntry = @is_header-cntry.\n    \"…use lt_map for the outbound XML mapping\n  ENDMETHOD.\n\nSo: you may persist data for a new-country process, but you do it via Custom Business Objects or value-mapping activities—not by creating a free-standing DDIC table.\n\nPlain-language summary  \nIn the public cloud you can’t build your own classic database table, but you can store the extra data you need for a new DRC country process by creating a Custom Business Object or by using the value-mapping/configuration apps that SAP provides.",

Register the handler class in configuration  \n   a. Fiori app “Manage eDocument Process”  \n      – Create (or copy) a process, assign version.  \n      – Enter ZCL_EDOC_EXT_XX as Handler Class.  \n      – Map each process step (CREATE, TRIGGER_SEND, …) to the corresponding method name.  \n   b. Implement BAdI EDOCUMENT_BASE_EXT (Enhancement spot ES_EDOCUMENT_EXT)  \n      – Filter by country = XX and (optionally) source document type.  \n      – Return cv_edoc_class_name = ‘ZCL_EDOC_EXT_XX’  \n        plus cv_process_name / cv_process_version.  \n   c.

You must work in the 3-system DEV/QAS/PRD landscape delivered for Developer Extensibility.  \n2. Only released objects can be used; no direct access to unreleased tables or DDIC types.  \n3. Register the new class in “Registering Handling Classes for Source Extension” IMG step so DRC calls it.  \n4. Use the GENERIC_FILTER mechanism (set in CHANGE_ADAPTOR_GENERIC_FILTER) to avoid impacting unrelated DRC scenarios.  \n5. No classic “enhancement-point” modification is allowed; everything is done via the released BAdI and interface.\n\nShort code outline\n\nCLASS zcl_edoc_src_fiinv DEFINITION  \n  PUBLIC FINAL CREATE PUBLIC.  \n  PUBLIC SECTION.  \n    INTERFACES if_edoc_source_process_ext.      \"implements the mapping  \nENDCLASS.\n\nCLASS zcl_edoc_src_fiinv IMPLEMENTATION.  \n  METHOD if_edoc_source_process_ext~map_xml_data.  \n    \"fill e_document-xml_root = …  \n  ENDMETHOD.  \n  METHOD if_edoc_source_process_ext~change_edocument_type.  \n    ev_edocument_type = 'FIN_INVOICE'.  \n  ENDMETHOD.  \n  METHOD if_edoc_source_process_ext~change_adaptor_generic_filter.  \n    ev_generic_filter = 'FIINV_FI'.  \n  ENDMETHOD.  \nENDCLASS.\n\nAfter deploying, create a matching BAdI implementation of EDOC_ADAPTOR_CLOUD filtered by GENERIC_FILTER = ‘FIINV_FI’ if you need post-mapping edits or runtime suppression.\n\nPlain-language takeaway  \nYou can indeed write ABAP classes to control how DRC builds its eDocuments in the public cloud, but you have to do it in the Developer-Extensibility area (using ADT) and follow the released interfaces/bAdIs—key-user tools alone are not sufficient.",

         "Technical explanation  \nTo make a brand-new eDocument “Process” (for example a country- or business-specific scenario that does not exist in standard) work in SAP S/4HANA Public Cloud you have to plug your own logic into the DRC framework at three defined enhancement points.  SAP delivers one cloud BAdI for each point; together they form the minimum set that must be implemented for every new process.  Two further BAdIs are optional and are only needed if you want to add custom fields or change the cockpit UI.  The BAdIs and their purpose are:\n\nRequired BAdIs  \n1. EDOC_PROCESS_DEF_CLOUD  \n   • Purpose: Register the new process, return its process type / subtype and map it to the correct handler classes.  \n   • Key method (interface IF_EDOC_PROCESS_DEF_CLOUD): GET_PROCESS_DEFINITION.  \n   • Source: SAP DRC extensibility documentation (tool output 6).\n\n2. EDOC_ADAPTOR_CLOUD  \n   • Purpose: Build the eDocument header/body out of the source application data (FI, SD, …) and decide in method IS_RELEVANT whether an eDocument shall be created at all.  \n   • Also lets you enhance the standard XML mapping.  \n   • Source: tool outputs 1, 2, 6.\n\n3. EDOC_INTERFACE_CONNECTOR (enhancement spot EDOC_INTERFACE_CONNECTOR, method SET_DRC_DATA)  \n   • Purpose: Hand over the payload produced by the adaptor to the DRC communication layer (CPI/iFlow or 3rd-party).  \n   • Gives you the chance to overwrite process_type, process_subtype, action, etc. before the call is sent.  \n   • Source: tool outputs 8, 9.\n\nOptional BAdIs (use only if needed)  \n4. EDOC_CUSTOM_FIELDS_CLOUD  \n   • Purpose: Append additional header or item fields to the payload for your new process.  \n   • Source: tool outputs 5, 6, 8.\n\n5. EDOC_CUSTOM_FIELDS_UI_CLOUD  \n   • Purpose: Expose those custom fields (and their labels, F4 help, validations) in the “Manage Electronic Documents” Fiori app.  \n   • Source: tool output 3, 5.\n\nTypical implementation sequence (snippet)  \n```abap\n* 1.

Tells the framework which eDocument Process Name and Version to use (method DETERMINE_PROCESS → CV_PROCESS_NAME and CV_PROCESS_VERSION).  \nIn other words, it is the switchboard that maps a source document to your own country-specific handler class and to the appropriate eDocument process definition you maintain in app “Manage eDocument Process” (table EDOC_TYPE).\n\nTypical implementation flow  \n• IMG: Cross-Application Components → SAP Document and Reporting Compliance → Framework Settings → Activate Additional eDocument Instance Creation  \n  – Register factory class CL_EDOC_FACTORY_EXT for the source document you want to extend.  \n• SE19 / ADT: Create an enhancement implementation for ES_EDOCUMENT_EXT.  \n  – Implement BAdI EDOCUMENT_BASE_EXT.  \n  – Maintain mandatory filter COUNTRY = ‘<ISO code>’.  \n  – Code the two methods, for example:\n\n  METHOD if_edocument_base_ext~determine_edocument_class.  \n    cv_edoc_class_name = 'ZCL_EDOC_US_HANDLER'.  \n  ENDMETHOD.\n\n  METHOD if_edocument_base_ext~determine_process.  \n    IF is_edocument-source_type = 'SD_INVOICE'.  \n       cv_process_name    = 'ZUS_INV'.  \n       cv_process_version = '0001'.  \n    ENDIF.  \n  ENDMETHOD.\n\n• Create the handler class (e.g. ZCL_EDOC_US_HANDLER) that contains your country logic, usually re-using CL_EDOCUMENT_EXT_ES helper methods.  \n• Make sure the process name/version returned by the BAdI exists and is active.\n\nConstraints  \n• Only one active implementation per country can be used (factory keeps the last one).  \n• Use the same country filter in companion BAdIs (EDOCUMENT_INT_CONN_EXT, EDOCUMENT_MESSAGE_EXT) to keep the process consistent.  \n• Debugging shortcut: breakpoint in CL_EDOC_FACTORY_EXT→CALL_BADI_BASE_EXT.\n\nPlain-language summary  \nBAdI EDOCUMENT_BASE_EXT is the “routing” exit that lets you plug your own handler class and process definition into SAP Document and Reporting Compliance whenever the system generates an eInvoice/eDocument, enabling country- or scenario-specific extensions beyond SAP standard.",

         "Technical explanation  \n1. In DRC the “process” object (configured in the Fiori app Manage eDocument Process) only describes the orchestration steps: which mapping, interface, message handling, etc.  \n2. A process is never called directly from SD, MM or FI. At runtime the framework first asks: “is this source document relevant for e-invoicing?”  ➜ That answer is stored in a key field EDOC_TYPE in table EDOCUMENT.  \n3. The eDocument Type is therefore the mandatory link between:  \n   • the source document/country (billing type, FI doc-type, delivery type …)  \n   • the extensibility artefacts (BAdI filter, XML structure, custom DB table)  \n   • one or several processes you later create in Manage eDocument Process.  \n4. When you create a brand-new scenario in Public Cloud you have no SAP-delivered eDocument Type that could be reused, so you must first create your own type (“Manage eDocument Type” → 4-character key).  \n   – Only after this exists can you map FI/SD document-types to it.  \n   – The process definition then simply refers to the same eDocument Type during step determination.  \n   – The cockpit (“Manage Electronic Documents”) shows and filters by that key.  \n5. Without an eDocument Type the framework cannot write an entry in EDOCUMENT, cannot determine the correct BAdI, and consequently cannot hand the document over to the process you defined—hence the step is obligatory.\n\nExample sequence for a custom “AR Invoice – MyCountry” scenario  \n1. Create eDocument Type MYAR (Manage eDocument Type).  \n2. (Optional) Generate a country-specific table ZEDO_MYAR with the wizard; the type automatically points to it.  \n3. Assign MYAR to SD billing types F2, G2 in “Assign eDocument Type to Billing Document Type”.  \n4. In Manage eDocument Process create Process ID MYAR_STD and select eDocument Type MYAR.  \n5. Map steps (Generate XML, Call CPI, Receive Response).  \nResult: every time an F2 invoice is saved, the framework picks type MYAR → writes EDOCUMENT → triggers Process MYAR_STD.\n\nPlain-language takeaway  \nYou create an eDocument Type first because it is the technical key that tells DRC “these source documents belong to my new electronic-invoicing scenario”; the process you build later can only run for documents that already carry that key.",

         "Technical answer (backed by SAP-documentation extracts)\n=======================================================  \nBefore an external partner can POST an e-invoice, order, or any other **electronic document** into an SAP S/4HANA Private-Cloud tenant that runs Document & Reporting Compliance (DRC), the following building blocks must already exist.\n\n1. Connectivity layer  \n   • Activate the HTTP service that DRC exposes for inbound traffic (tool #1).  \n   • Register this service in SAP Cloud Connector and map it to your on-prem/private-cloud backend (tool #1).  \n   • Create a dedicated bgRFC destination for the DRC queue (one per application) to avoid name clashes (tool #1).\n\n2. Security & user authentication  \n   • Create a Communication User (SU01 or Fiori “Maintain Communication Users”).  \n   • Decide on – and configure – ONE of the supported auth. methods (tool #2):  \n     – OAuth2 / SAML / OIDC bearer token  \n     – x.509 client certificate  \n     – Basic user/password (least secure; not recommended)  \n   • Import partner certificates or IdP metadata in STRUST; make sure the root CA is on SAP’s global trust list (SAP Note 2801396).\n\n3. Partner system definition  \n   • Communication System: store the sender’s host name, port, and the technical user/certificate. Flag the system as “Inbound Only”.  \n   • Communication Arrangement: bind the correct SAP-delivered scenario to that system, e.g.  \n     – SAP_COM_0313  Business Document Processing (invoices)  \n     – SAP_COM_0811  Purchase Order Integration  \n   The screen will reveal the exact inbound URL and permitted operations.\n\n4. DRC-specific plumbing  \n   • Maintain logical port CO_EDO_UBL_SEND_APPL_RESP_V1_0 if you expect Peppol/UBL responses (tool #1).  \n   • Switch on “Receiving of Invoice Responses” for the Sender Participant in DRC.  \n   • In Fiori “Manage Destination Mappings – Outgoing”, enter the Logical System ID of your backend as the Source ID (tool #1).  \n   • Ensure SAP AIF is active so interface errors are logged and can be re-processed (tool #1).\n\n5. Endpoint hand-off to the partner  \n   Example URL shown in the Communication Arrangement:  \n   https://my-s4.private-cloud.company.com/sap/opu/odata/sap/API_BUSINESS_DOCUMENT_SRV/  \n   Provide:  \n   – HTTP method: POST  \n   – Supported payload (JSON or XML as per the API)  \n   – Authentication artefact (token / client cert / user+pwd)  \n   – Optional header x-sap-security-session: “Create” to reuse the same logon session and save CPU (SAP Notes 3201227 & 3319136).\n\n6. Smoke test & monitoring  \n   • Call the URL once with curl or Postman; expect HTTP 401 if creds are missing, 403 if role is wrong, 201/202 if accepted.  \n   • Troubleshoot via /IWFND/ERROR_LOG (OData), SRT_UTIL (SOAP), or Fiori “Display Connectivity Trace”.\n\nPlain-language takeaway\n-----------------------\nCreate a technical user, register the sender system and the correct communication scenario, activate the DRC inbound service through Cloud Connector, and enable the DRC monitoring pieces—once these are in place the external partner can safely push documents into your SAP S/4HANA Private-Cloud tenant.\n\nQuick check-list example\n------------------------\n1. SU01 → COMUSR_EXTDOC (no dialog)  \n2. Fiori “Communication Systems” → SYS_EXTDOC_IN (Inbound Only, OAuth2)  \n3. Fiori “Communication Arrangements” → SAP_COM_0313 ↔ SYS_EXTDOC_IN  \n4. STRUST → import partner TLS & signing certs  \n5. SICF → activate /sap/bc/…/edoc_inbound_srv  \n6. Cloud Connector → map /sap/bc/…/edoc_inbound_srv to backend  \n7. SPRO → bgRFC destination EDOC_INB_Q  \n8. Fiori “Manage Destination Mappings – Outgoing” → Source ID = <SIDCLNT100>\n\nYou can now inform the partner of the URL, token endpoint, or certificate finger-print, and start receiving documents.",

         "Technical explanation  \nBefore an external platform (for example an integration tenant or a supplier portal) can push e-documents into an SAP S/4HANA Cloud, private edition system, SAP Document and Reporting Compliance (DRC) expects the following one-time system settings:\n\n1. bgRFC inbound destination  \n   • Create one dedicated inbound destination in bgRFC (transaction SBGRFCCONF or task list STC01) for each DRC application so that queue names remain unique.  \n2. HTTP service activation  \n   • Activate the ICF node /sap/bc/s4/edoc_in (or the node delivered for your release) so that the private-edition system can accept HTTPS calls coming from the cloud edition.  \n3. SAP Cloud Connector configuration  \n   • Expose the activated ICF node through Cloud Connector and assign it to an SAP BTP sub-account where the DRC, cloud edition is subscribed.  \n4. Connectivity setup in DRC, cloud edition  \n   • In the “System Connectivity” app of the cloud edition, create a destination of type “On-Premise” that points to the Cloud Connector virtual host and port.  \n5. Destination mapping (Manage Destination Mappings – Outgoing)  \n   • Maintain a mapping that tells DRC which target system (your private-edition logical system) is to receive which document type.  \n   • Source ID = <logical-system-ID>#<client>, where the Logical System ID is taken from table TBDLS of the private-edition system.  \n6. SAP Application Interface Framework (AIF) enablement  \n   • Install/activate AIF and import the AIF BC-Sets delivered with DRC (SAP Notes 2010697, 2324010, 2440686).  \n   • Create or reuse an AIF error-handling application so that inbound messages are logged and can be restarted.  \n7. SAP Note implementation  \n   • Implement SAP Note 3442326 (or the note listed for your specific country/solution) to receive the latest inbound proxy corrections.  \n\nWhen all seven items are in place, the cloud edition can successfully POST the UBL/Peppol (or local) XML to the private-edition system; bgRFC queues it, AIF validates and posts it, and DRC creates the e-document in the back-end.\n\nPlain-language summary  \nTurn on the HTTP endpoint, route it through Cloud Connector, tell the cloud edition where to call, activate AIF for monitoring, and create a dedicated bgRFC destination—once those pieces are set up, external systems can feed documents into your SAP S/4HANA Cloud, private edition tenant.\n\nExample snippets  \n\n• Logical System ID (SE16 → table TBDLS)  \n  BUKRS01      Logical System for PCE client 100  \n\n• Destination mapping entry in cloud edition  \n  Source ID        Target ID         Doc.Type  \n  BUKRS01#100      PCECLNT100        INVOICE  \n\n• ICF node path to expose  \n  /sap/bc/s4/edoc_in —> HTTPS, exposed via Cloud Connector to host pce-drcedi.internal:443",

They ensure that ABAP extensibility, cloud connectivity, and the electronic-document framework are all ready for an enhancement implementation.\n\nPrerequisite checklist  \n1. Contracting and authorizations  \n   • Active license for SAP Document and Reporting Compliance  \n   • Subscription to SAP Integration Suite (used for message exchange with outside platforms)  \n   • PFCG roles that permit ADT development and DRC customizing\n\n2. System landscape ready  \n   • Three-system SAP S/4HANA (DEV/QAS/PRD) tenant where DRC is activated  \n   • Communication arrangement set up between S/4HANA and BTP Integration Suite\n\n3. Development tooling  \n   • Eclipse-based ABAP Development Tools (ADT) installed and configured for your DEV tenant  \n   • Extensibility scenario “Electronic Document Processing Framework” enabled in the SAP Fiori app “Custom Logic” (BAdI framework)\n\n4. Foundational DRC configuration  \n   • Basic eDocument framework customizing completed (EDOC_CUST, output channels, EDOC_ADAPT_...)  \n   • Country/region solution installed or at least the “Global Template” scope item activated\n\n5. Connectivity & runtime components  \n   • Cloud connector or direct SAP Cloud Connector destination created for RFC calls, if on-premise back-end is involved  \n   • CPI/iFlow package “SAP Document and Reporting Compliance – Peppol / Country XYZ” (or your specific one) deployed but left in “placeholder” status for your new mappings\n\n6. Source-document readiness  \n   • Source application (e.g., SD billing, FI invoice, MM invoice) configured so that an electronic-document trigger event exists (EDOC_TRIGGER view, EDOC_ADAPTER assignment)  \n   • Test data created to generate at least one sample eDocument instance\n\n7. Governance & transport setup  \n   • CTS or gCTS transport route for ABAP and DRC customizing confirmed  \n   • Naming conventions and namespace for custom DDIC objects reserved in /nSOBJ\n\nOnce all seven areas are ticked off, you can create the custom BAdI implementation in ADT, upload or build the mapping in CPI, and test the new process end-to-end.\n\nPlain-language summary  \nMake sure you have the right licenses, connected systems, developer tools, baseline DRC configuration, and transport governance in place before you start coding a new electronic-document process in SAP DRC.",

Identify the correct enhancement point  \n   • For the “last-minute” manipulation of the XML that leaves SAP and is posted to AADE-myDATA you must implement BAdI EDOC_CLOUD_XML_MODIFY, delivered in enhancement spot ES_EDOCUMENT_CLOUD.  \n   • Other Greece-specific BAdIs (EDOC_GR_VAT_CLASSIF, EDOC_GR_CLASSIF_DETAIL, …) run earlier in the build process; only EDOC_CLOUD_XML_MODIFY changes the final XML stream.\n\n2. Create the BAdI implementation in ADT (ABAP Development Tools)  \n   a. In ADT choose File → New → Enhancement Implementation.  \n   b. Enter Enhancement Spot ES_EDOCUMENT_CLOUD and select BAdI EDOC_CLOUD_XML_MODIFY.  \n   c. Maintain filter values to restrict the logic to Greece (LAND = ‘GR’) and, if required, to a single eDocument type (e.g. ‘GR_INV’).  \n   d. ADT generates a class that implements interface IF_EDOC_CLOUD_XML_MODIFY with two methods:  \n      – MODIFY_XML (changing cv_xml TYPE xstring)  \n      – CHECK_XML (raising exceptions to block the send step).\n\n3.

Activate and transport  \n   • Activate the enhancement implementation and its class.  \n   • Assign the object to a transport request for onward movement to the Q and P tenants.\n\n6. Test the enhancement  \n   • Post an invoice, open Fiori app “Manage Electronic Documents” (or EDOC_COCKPIT).  \n   • Trigger “Submit”.  \n   • In “Processing Log” you should see step “BAdI: EDOC_CLOUD_XML_MODIFY – implementation ZGR_XMLMOD” executed.  \n   • Display the file in AIF or Cockpit History to verify the injected node/value.\n\n7. Runtime behaviour  \n   • SAP Document & Reporting Compliance calls method MODIFY_XML right before the AIF outbound interface sends the payload to SAP Integration Suite.  \n   • Any exception raised in CHECK_XML sets the eDocument to status “Error in Extensibility” so the document never reaches AADE.\n\nPlain-language summary  \nIn a Private-Cloud system you change the Greece e-invoice XML by implementing BAdI EDOC_CLOUD_XML_MODIFY with ADT: create the enhancement, insert ABAP code in method MODIFY_XML to alter the DOM/xstring, activate it, and test the result in the eDocument Cockpit before the file is sent to the Greek tax authority.",

         "Technical explanation  \nYes – in an SAP S/4HANA Private Cloud system you are allowed to enhance (“extend”) the standard eDocument Customer-Invoice process for Italy. SAP ships the eDocument Framework with a set of enhancement points (BAdIs) that remain open in Private Cloud. Typical extension options confirmed by SAP Help and official documentation are:\n\n1. Custom decision logic  \n   • BAdI EDOC_CHECK_CREATE – decide at run-time whether an eDocument should be created for a given FI or SD invoice.\n\n2. XML manipulation just before submission  \n   • BAdI EDOC_MODIFY_FINAL_XML – read/change the already-mapped XML, add extra tags, run last-minute validations, or set an error flag to stop submission.\n\n3. Additional business data (custom fields)  \n   • Create the field in the “Custom Fields” Fiori app (business context “Document Compliance”).  \n   • Implement BAdI EDOC_CUSTOM_FIELDS (back end) to fill the field in table EDODE/EDODI.  \n   • Implement BAdI EDOC_CUSTOM_FIELDS_UI (UI) to show it in the Fiori “Manage Electronic Documents” list.\n\n4. Country-specific mappings (if needed)  \n   • Copy the mapping class (e.g. CL_EDOC_MAP_IT_FATTURA) into a Z-class and assign it in IMG activity “Activate Additional eDocument Instance Creation”.\n\n5. myDATA or other localisation exits (Greece example in SAP Help)  \n   • EDOC_DET_INV_TYPE, EDOC_DET_VAT_CLASS, EDOC_DET_CLASS_DETAILS, etc.\n\nConfiguration prerequisites  \n– IMG → Cross-Application Components → SAP Document and Reporting Compliance: activate source documents, assign eDocument types, and maintain “Process Communication Through Cloud Services” for each company code.  \n– Your BAdIs run only when these settings mark the source invoice as relevant.\n\nWhat you cannot change  \n– Core legal validations enforced by the Italian SDI schema.  \n– Cloud Integration content delivered by SAP (unless you copy the iFlow into a customer package).  \n– Digital signature logic delivered by SAP.\n\nExample (simplified) – add an extra <AdditionalData> tag  \nMETHOD if_ex_edoc_modify_final_xml~modify_final_xml.  \n  DATA(lo_xml) = cl_xml_document=>create_with_xml( ct_xml ).  \n  lo_xml->find_or_create_node( name = 'FatturaElettronicaHeader/AdditionalData'  \n                               value = ls_mydata ).  \n  ct_xml = lo_xml->get_xml( ).  \nENDMETHOD.\n\nPlain-language takeaway  \nBecause Private Cloud gives you access to SAP’s BAdI enhancement framework, you can safely add your own checks, fields, and XML changes to the Italian eInvoice (customer invoice) process without breaking SAP support or legal compliance.",

Here's the reasoning:\n\n1. Accuracy: The answer correctly states that it is possible to add custom actions in the eDocument Cockpit, which aligns with both the expert answer and the tool-provided context. However, it doesn't mention the use of Business Add-Ins (BAdIs) for implementing custom logic, which is an important point from the tool-provided context.\n\n2. Completeness: The generated answer provides a detailed step-by-step guide on how to create and implement a custom action, which goes beyond the expert answer in terms of implementation details. This is helpful for users who want to understand the process. However, it misses some key points mentioned in the tool-provided context, such as the use of the Custom Logic app and the integration with SAP Document and Reporting Compliance.\n\n3. Relevance: The answer is relevant to the question and provides practical information on how to implement custom actions. It correctly mentions the use of the \"Manage eDocument Process\" app, which is not mentioned in the expert answer but is likely a key tool for this process.\n\n4. Consistency with provided context: While the answer is generally consistent with the expert answer, it doesn't fully align with all the information provided by the sap_documentation_summary tool.

         "Technical explanation  \n• In SAP S/4HANA Private Cloud you cannot overwrite or enhance the SAP-delivered actions (SUBMIT, RESUBMIT, CANCEL, …) that appear in the standard cockpit processes (e.g. “CLINV”, “ITINV”).  \n• What you can do is deliver your own action(s) as part of a customer-specific process that you create with the app “Manage eDocument Process” (Process Manager).  \n\nHow to do it  \n1. Create or copy a process header in “Manage eDocument Process”.  \n2. In the process customise the following tables (all done in the same Fiori app):\n   – Actions incl. Variants for a Process → add your action code, e.g. “SEND_TO_PARTNER | TEST”.  \n   – Process Steps Executed by an Action → map the action to one or more technical steps.  \n   – Process Toolbar Function Assignment → decide where the button appears in the cockpit.  \n3. Implement the ABAP step classes that contain the logic to be executed by the action.  \n   • Each step class must implement IF_EDOCUMENT_EXT_ES (or your own interface) and return a result code that you maintained under “Process Step Result”.  \n4. Optionally use Custom Logic BAdIs (e.g. EDOCUMENT_BASE_EXT, EDOCUMENT_INT_CONN_EXT) if the action needs to call external services or change XML content.  \n5. Activate the process (dialog node “Manage Electronic Documents App: Process” → flag “Active”) and assign an eDocument Type to your source documents in the “Manage eDocument Type” app.  \n6. The new button now shows up only when a document belongs to your custom process; SAP-delivered cockpit processes remain unchanged.\n\nImportant limitations  \n• SAP does not allow you to insert extra buttons into an SAP-delivered process; any UI change must live in your own process.  \n• The cockpit checks that every action has a corresponding step variant; otherwise the button is disabled.  \n• Transport the configuration like normal customizing; ABAP classes/logic travel in workbench requests.\n\nExample (simplified)  \nAction definition  \n  Action        Variant  \n  ────────────  ───────  \n  SEND_TO_PARTNER  TEST  \n\nProcess-step mapping  \n  Action “SEND_TO_PARTNER” executes step “SUBMIT_XML” (variant “TEST”).  \n\nABAP skeleton  \nCLASS zcl_edoc_step_submit_xml DEFINITION  \n  PUBLIC FINAL CREATE PUBLIC.  \n  PUBLIC SECTION.  \n    INTERFACES if_edocument_ext_es.  \nENDCLASS.  \n\nMETHOD if_edocument_ext_es~execute.  \n  \"…build XML and send to partner…  \n  rv_result = 'OK'.  \nENDMETHOD.\n\nPlain-language answer  \nYes—you can add your own action in the cockpit, but only inside a custom eDocument process that you create and maintain with “Manage eDocument Process”; standard SAP actions themselves cannot be extended.",

         "Technical explanation (based only on the two SAP Help extractions returned above)\n\n1. Copy or create the eDocument Process  \n   • App / IMG activity: “Manage eDocument Process”.  \n   • Give the process a key (country-code + name).  \n   • Re-use or build the required Process Steps and assign the ABAP implementation classes that will later execute the business logic.\n\n2. Define the new eDocument Action itself  \n   • Inside the same app choose “Actions incl. Variants for a Process”.  \n   • Add a line for every Action/Variant you need (for example CREATE, SUBMIT, CANCEL, DISPLAY_XML).  \n   • Mandatory entry for an auto-creation scenario: CREATE|HOOK.  \n   • Maintain a description that will appear as the button text in Cockpit / Manage Electronic Documents.\n\n3. Map the Action to its technical execution  \n   • Menu path “Process Steps Executed by an Action”.  \n   • Link each Action-Variant to one or more of the Process Steps created in step 1.  \n   • Flag “Included” if the step is embedded in another.\n\n4. Make the Action visible in the UI (optional)  \n   • “Process Toolbar Function Assignment” – place the button and decide its group / order.\n\n5. Add custom ABAP logic if the standard framework is not enough  \n   • Implement or enhance the ABAP classes that were entered as Process Steps.  \n   • For XML manipulation or validation use the cloud-ready BAdI “Cloud EDOC Adaptor: Modify Final Invoice XML” (technical ID BADI_EDOC_ADAPTOR_MODIFY_XML, enhancement spot ES_EDOCUMENT_CLOUD).  \n   • Implement the BAdI through the “Custom Logic” Fiori app; method IF_EDOC_XML_MODIFY~MODIFY_XML( ) lets you change or reject the XML before it is saved.  \n\n     Example skeleton  \n     ```\n     METHOD if_edoc_xml_modify~modify_xml.\n       LOOP AT ct_xml ASSIGNING <lfs_seg>.\n         IF <lfs_seg>-name = 'cbc:AccountingCost'.\n           <lfs_seg>-value = 'Z_CUSTOM_COST_CTR'.\n         ENDIF.\n       ENDLOOP.\n     ENDMETHOD.\n     ```\n\n6. Transport & activate  \n   • In Private Cloud, Custom Logic implementations create an automatically managed transport.  \n   • Activate the eDocument Process in “Manage Electronic Documents – Process” so that the cockpit recognises the new action.\n\n7. Background automation (if required)  \n   • App: “Schedule eDocument Jobs – General”.  \n   • Template: “eDocument (General): Process Actions in the Background”.  \n   • Select your Process and the newly created Action.  \n   • SAP Help explicitly advises NOT to schedule UI-type actions such as DISPLAY_XML.\n\n8. Authorisations  \n   • Standard role SAP_BR_BILLING_CLERK (or country variant) already contains the S_EJOB activity needed for executing or scheduling the action.\n\nOne-sentence plain-language summary  \nCreate or copy the eDocument Process, add the action with its variants in “Manage eDocument Process”, link it to your ABAP step implementation, optionally enrich the XML with the Cloud EDOC Adaptor BAdI via the Custom Logic app, transport and activate it, and—if desired—run it in background using the standard job template.",

         "The generated answer is fully helpful because it accurately addresses the user's question about extending the Manage Electronic Documents app and the eDocument Cockpit App in Private Cloud. It provides a comprehensive step-by-step guide on how to add custom fields, including the use of specific tools (Custom Fields app and Custom Logic app) and BAdIs (EDOC_CUSTOM_FIELDS_CLOUD and EDOC_CUSTOM_FIELDS_UI_CLOUD). The answer goes beyond the expert answer by offering additional context on effects, limitations, and caveats. It is well-structured with both technical explanations and a plain-language summary, making it accessible to users with varying levels of expertise. The information provided is consistent with the context from the sap_documentation_summary tool and offers valuable insights for users considering implementing these extensions.",

         "Technical explanation (key points)\n\n1. Yes – SAP S/4HANA Cloud, private edition lets you add your own fields to BOTH\n   • Fiori app “Manage Electronic Documents” (app ID F3233, successor of EDOC_COCKPIT)  \n   • SAP GUI / Fiori launchpad transaction EDOC_COCKPIT\n\n2. What you have to do\n\nStep 1 – Create the field  \n• Launch “Custom Fields” (Fiori app F1502).  \n• Business Context = Document Compliance.  \n• Define the field (label, data type, length) and press Publish.  \n  → The system appends the field to the eDocument include and to the CDS-view I_EDOCCOCKPIT that feeds both UIs.\n\nStep 2 – Fill the field at run time  \n• Launch “Custom Logic” (Fiori app F1871) or ADT.  \n• Create enhancement for BAdI EDOC_CUSTOM_FIELDS_CLOUD (business context Document Compliance).  \n• Maintain filter “Process” (e.g. AR_INVOICE, AR_CN, …).  \n• ABAP (restricted ABAP Cloud syntax) reads the source document (VBRK, BKPF, etc.) and moves data into the new field, for example:  \n  `edoc_extension-zz_sales_org = source_vbrk-vkorg.`  \n• Publish.\n\nOptional UI behaviour  \n• If you need to set default values, hide, make mandatory, or change position of the column, implement BAdI EDOC_CUSTOM_FIELDS_UI_CLOUD.  \n• You can also use “Adapt UI” on the Fiori app to decide whether the column appears in the list or the filter bar.\n\n3. Effects\n• Field is stored in runtime table /1ACC/EDOC_CF_* and is shown in both cockpit apps (list, object page, filter).  \n• The value is available in the XML mapping engine; you can include it in the outbound XML via BAdI EDOC_OUTPUT_PRE_PROCESS_CLOUD if required.  \n• You may add the field to authorisation object EDOC_ORGU to restrict visibility by organisational unit.\n\n4. Limits / caveats\n• Once the custom field is published it cannot be deleted, only hidden.  \n• The feature is delivered only from SAP S/4HANA Cloud 2105 (OP 2021 FPS1) upwards.  \n• For Public Cloud (multi-tenant) the same procedure works, but coding is limited to key-user ABAP only; in Private Cloud you can also implement classic BAdIs in SE18 if preferred.\n\nPlain-language summary\nYes—you can enhance the Manage Electronic Documents / eDocument Cockpit in a Private-Cloud system by creating a custom field with the “Custom Fields” app and filling it through the delivered BAdI EDOC_CUSTOM_FIELDS_CLOUD; afterwards the field is visible in the cockpit, can be filtered on, and can even be written to the outgoing XML.",
