         "To attach additional files to the standard XML in Public Cloud, you can use the Business Add-In (BAdI) EDOC_ADAPTOR_CLOUD and enhance the XML file generated for an electronic document.\nBy enhancing the XML file, you can include additional information that may be relevant for your business processes .\nTo implement this enhancement, you can follow these steps in ABAP Development Tools (ADT):\n1. In your ABAP project, go to the enhancement spot ES_EDOCUMENT_CLOUD and select 'New BAdI Enhancement Implementation'.\n2. Enter a package, name, and description for the implementation.\n3. Choose 'Add BAdI Implementation' and select EDOC_ADAPTOR_CLOUD .\n4. (Optional) Create a BAdI filter for Country and/or Generic Filter.\n5. Choose 'Implementing Class' to create a new implementation class.\n6. Activate your BAdI implementation .\nOnce you have implemented the BAdI, you can fill the XML tag <BuyersItemIdentification> with the desired additional information.\nThis can be done by reading the relevant data from the source documents and filling the appropriate XML tags.\nPlease note that the specific implementation details may vary depending on your system setup and requirements.\nIt is recommended to refer to the provided sources for more detailed instructions and examples.",

         "Technical explanation (S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition)\n\n1. Which SAP object is used  \n   • BAdI: EDOC_ADAPTOR  \n   • Method: SET_OUTPUT_DATA (Business Context “Electronic Document – Adapter”)  \n   This BAdI is released for key-user extension in the “Custom Logic” Fiori app.\n\n2. Runtime position  \n   SET_OUTPUT_DATA is called after the standard XML for the eDocument has been generated but before it is handed over to SAP Document and Reporting Compliance (DRC).  \n   – Import:   IS_EDOCUMENT (header, message type, country, …)  \n   – Changing: CS_OUTPUT (xstring with the XML)  \n   – Changing: CT_ATTACHMENT (table; filename, MIME type, content)\n\n3. Steps to add an extra file  \n   a) Fetch or build the binary file (xstring).  \n      • Read it from the Attachment List of the source document via CL_ATTACHMENTS_API* classes, or  \n      • Generate the file on the fly.  \n   b) Append a new line to CT_ATTACHMENT:  \n\n      APPEND VALUE #(  \n         filename  = ‘myCertificate.pdf’  \n         mimetype  = ‘application/pdf’  \n         content   = lv_pdf_xstring        “base64 not needed; framework encodes”  \n      ) TO ct_attachment.\n\n   c) OPTIONAL – embed a reference into the XML if the local format (e.g. Peppol BIS, CFDI, XRechnung) requires <AdditionalDocumentReference>:  \n\n      DATA(lo_xml) = cl_sxml_string_reader=>create( cs_output ).  \n      “navigate / insert new cac:AdditionalDocumentReference element”  \n      “set ID, DocumentTypeCode, IssueDate and an EmbeddedDocumentBinaryObject with the file name & MIME”  \n      cs_output = lo_xml->get_output( ).\n\n4. Size & type limits (public cloud)  \n   • Max single attachment: 10 MB (EDOC_FRAMEWORK constant)  \n   • MIME type must be on SAP-delivered whitelist (see SSCUI “Define MIME Types for eDocument Attachments”).  \n   • Total message (XML + all files) must stay below 30 MB.\n\n5. Test cycle  \n   – Run app “Display Electronic Documents” → simulate output.  \n   – Check application log object EDOCUMENT in SLG1 for message EDOCUMENT613 (archiving) or MIME errors.  \n   – If the recipient uses Peppol Exchange, verify in the Peppol Monitor that the attachment is forwarded.\n\nCode sketch (abbreviated)\n\n  METHOD if_edoc_adaptor~set_output_data.\n\n    DATA: ls_attach TYPE edoc_output_attach_s,\n          lv_xstring TYPE xstring.\n\n    \"1) Get binary from Attachment Service\n    cl_hdm_attachment_srv=>download(\n        EXPORTING i_object_id = is_edocument-ref_object_id\n        IMPORTING e_binary    = lv_xstring ).\n\n    \"2) Fill attach structure\n    ls_attach-filename = 'inspection_certificate.pdf'.\n    ls_attach-mimetype = 'application/pdf'.\n    ls_attach-content  = lv_xstring.\n\n    \"3) Add to outbound package\n    APPEND ls_attach TO ct_attachment.\n\n    \"4) (Optional) insert <AdditionalDocumentReference> into XML...\n    \"   manipulate cs_output  (see step 3c)\n\n  ENDMETHOD.\n\nPlain-language takeaway:  \nCreate an implementation of BAdI EDOC_ADAPTOR (method SET_OUTPUT_DATA) in the “Custom Logic” app, fetch the file you want to send, add it to the provided attachment table, and—if needed—insert a matching AdditionalDocumentReference element in the XML.

Completeness: The answer covers all parts of the question, including the code implementation, explanation of the logic, and steps to put the code in the system.\n\n3. Alignment with SAP documentation: The answer aligns well with the SAP documentation retrieved from the tools. It correctly addresses the specific requirements for the France B2B eInvoice process and Settlement Management Documents.\n\n4. Improvements needed:\n   a. The answer doesn't explicitly mention that the provided implementation is an enhancement of the standard SAP code. The tool output shows that the original method was almost empty, which could have been highlighted.\n   b. The answer could have mentioned that this implementation is specific to the CL_EDOC_MAP_FR_B2B_STLMT class, as shown in the tool output.\n   c. The explanation of the fallback logic (steps 2 and 3 in the rule explanation) could be more clearly tied to the code implementation.\n\n5. Additional context: The answer doesn't incorporate some relevant information from the SAP documentation summary, such as the specific scenarios where this implementation would be applicable (e.g., France to France transactions).\n\nOverall, while the answer is largely correct and helpful, it could be improved by incorporating more context from the SAP documentation and explicitly relating the implementation to the standard SAP code.",

         "Technical explanation  \n• In the standard class CL_EDOC_MAP_FR_B2B_STLMT the method FILL_ORDER_REFERENCE is delivered almost empty – it just “CLEAR rs_order_reference”, because SAP assumed no sales-order information is available for Settlement-Management (SM) invoices.  \n• To activate the source type “Settlement Management Documents” you simply redefine the method in the same class (implicit enhancement) or—in your own Z-sub-class—copy the FI logic and replace the source tables by the SM header (WBRK) and the SM/SD link table WB2_D_BVDETAIL.  \n• The rule normally accepted by French B2B (and by the EU EN16931 semantic model) is:  \n  1. Take the customer reference that the payer typed on the billing document. For SM that is field WBRK-XBLNR.  \n  2. If XBLNR is blank, fall back to the underlying sales-order reference by reading the first billing document that the settlement doc contains and drilling down to the SD order ➔ VBKD-BSTKD / VBAK-BSTNK.  \n  3. If nothing is found, leave OrderReference empty (the XSD allows it).  \n\nExample code (redefinition)  \n\n```abap\nMETHOD fill_order_reference.\n  DATA: lv_sales_order  TYPE vbeln_va,\n        lv_cust_ref     TYPE bstkd,\n        ls_bvdetail     TYPE wb2_d_bvdetail.\n\n  \"------------------------------------------------------------------\n  \"* 1) Customer reference typed on the Settlement-Doc header (XBLNR)\n  \"------------------------------------------------------------------\n  rs_order_reference-id-base-content = ms_source-komlfk-xblnr.\n\n  IF rs_order_reference-id-base-content IS NOT INITIAL.\n    RETURN.                                    \"we are done\n  ENDIF.\n\n  \"------------------------------------------------------------------\n  \"* 2) Derive the reference from the first billing document that    \"\n  \"*    belongs to the settlement doc and drill down to the order   \"\n  \"------------------------------------------------------------------\n  SELECT  num\n          wbeln                  \"settlement doc#\n          doc_id                 \"billing document (VBRK)\n    FROM  wb2_d_bvdetail\n    INTO  ls_bvdetail\n    WHERE wbeln          =  @ms_source-komlfk-wbeln\n      AND doc_type       =  '02'          \"billing doc line\n      AND settl_doc_type =  ''            \"normal invoice\n    ORDER BY num                          \"take the first one\n    UP TO 1 ROWS.\n  ENDSELECT.\n\n  IF sy-subrc = 0.\n    \"billing -> sales order\n    SELECT SINGLE aubel FROM vbrp\n      INTO lv_sales_order\n      WHERE vbeln = @ls_bvdetail-doc_id.\n\n    IF sy-subrc = 0.\n      \"header purchase-order ref.

SE24 → CL_EDOC_MAP_FR_B2B_STLMT → Method FILL_ORDER_REFERENCE → Redefine.  \n   (If the class is standard-delivered and cannot be enhanced, create ZCL_EDOC_MAP_FR_B2B_STLMT that inherits from it and switch to it in the eDocument customizing.)  \n2. Paste the code above, activate.  \n3. In SPRO → Financial Accounting → eDocument → France B2B → Map Source Types, add the new mapping class for source type “06 = Settlement Management”.  \n\nPlain-language summary  \nReplace the empty method with a small routine that first takes field XBLNR of the settlement document; if that is blank it jumps to the first underlying billing document, reads the related SD sales order and copies the customer’s PO number—thus filling the OrderReference element required by the France B2B XML.",

         "Technical explanation  \n• In the France B2B mapping layer the superclass CL_EDOC_MAP_FR_B2B_SD already contains logic for FI and SD billing documents.  \n• For Settlement-Management (SM) billing documents (table KOMLFK) you have to create / activate the subclass CL_EDOC_MAP_FR_B2B_STLMT and redefine method FILL_INVOICE_TYPE_CODE.  \n• The method simply translates the SM billing type (KOMLFK-LFART) delivered by the source structure into the France tax-authority code by means of a value-mapping object.  \n• A separate value map “INVOICE_TYPE_CODE_SM” must exist in Customizing (IMG → Cross-Application Components → Document and Reporting Compliance → Mapping → Maintain Value Mapping) that holds the correspondence between LFART and the French B2B invoice-type codes.\n\nCode sample (redefinition in CL_EDOC_MAP_FR_B2B_STLMT)\n\n```abap\nMETHOD fill_invoice_type_code.\n  \"-----------------------------------------------------------------\n  \" Purpose : Determine the UBL/Factur-X InvoiceTypeCode\n  \"           for Settlement-Management billing documents\n  \"-----------------------------------------------------------------\n  \"  ms_source-komlfk-lfart  … SD Settlement Mgmt billing type\n  \"  rv_invoice_type_code    … output to XML (BT-010 / 1001)\n  \"-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n  rv_invoice_type_code = get_value_mapping(\n                           iv_vmapname    = 'INVOICE_TYPE_CODE_SM'   \"Custom value map\n                           iv_int_value   = ms_source-komlfk-lfart  \"LFART from KOMLFK\n                           iv_err_msg_ind = abap_false               \"No hard error\n                         ).\n\nENDMETHOD.\n```\n\n• If no entry is found the method returns INITIAL; standard post-processing in the framework then falls back to the default invoice-type code handling.  \n• You can switch iv_err_msg_ind to abap_true if you prefer the mapping framework to raise an error when LFART is missing in the value map.\n\nPlain-language summary  \nCreate subclass CL_EDOC_MAP_FR_B2B_STLMT, redefine FILL_INVOICE_TYPE_CODE to read LFART from KOMLFK and convert it via the value-map “INVOICE_TYPE_CODE_SM”; the snippet above is all that is required for Settlement-Management invoices to obtain the correct France B2B InvoiceTypeCode.",

         "Technical explanation  \n• For French B2B invoices that originate from Condition-Contract Settlement (source type STLMT_INV), the contract number you must expose in the XML already sits in structure KOMLFK (field CONTRACT).  \n• The France B2B standard mapping class CL_EDOC_MAP_FR_B2B_SD does not “know” this structure, therefore you create a subclass for settlement (or use SAP’s CL_EDOC_MAP_FR_B2B_STLMT if it exists) and override method FILL_CONTRACT_REFERENCE.  \n• Inside ms_source-komlfk you can also distinguish between different contract categories (field CONTRACT_TYPE).  For B2B e-invoice the French specification only wants the condition-contract (code ‘1’).  \n• The contract reference element in the SAP UBL proxy is rs_contract_reference-id-base-base-content; populating that field is enough—no further attributes are required.\n\nSample redefinition (ABAP)  \n\n```abap\n\"Class  ZCL_EDOC_MAP_FR_B2B_STLMT  (sub-class of CL_EDOC_MAP_FR_B2B_SD)\n\"Method FILL_CONTRACT_REFERENCE\n\nMETHOD fill_contract_reference.\n\n  \"Pass contract number from Settlement Management (KOMLFK)\n  \"Only take true condition contracts (CONTRACT_TYPE = '1')\n  IF ms_source-komlfk-contract_type = '1'\n     AND ms_source-komlfk-contract      IS NOT INITIAL.\n\n    rs_contract_reference-id-base-base-content =\n        ms_source-komlfk-contract.           \"e.g. 0004711\n\n  ENDIF.\n\nENDMETHOD.\n```\n\nWhat the code does  \n1. Checks the contract category so that only a condition contract (required by French rules) is forwarded.  \n2. Moves the settlement contract number to the UBL node ContractDocumentReference/ID.  \n3. Leaves the structure empty if no relevant contract exists; the framework will skip the tag.\n\nAfter the redefinition  \n• Activate the source type “Settlement Management Documents” (STLMT_INV) for your company code in IMG activity “Activate Source Type Documents for CoCd”.  \n• Map every relevant Settlement Document Type (e.g. 0S12, ZS33) to eDocument type FRB2BINV in IMG activity “Assign eDocument Type to Settlement Document Type”.  \n• No further BAdI or enhancement is needed; the framework will now build a France-compliant B2B XML that contains the required <ContractDocumentReference><ID> element.\n\nPlain-language summary  \nCreate (or use) a settlement-specific mapping class, override method FILL_CONTRACT_REFERENCE, and copy KOMLFK-CONTRACT into the XML when the contract type is ‘1’; then activate the STLMT source type in customizing and your French B2B settlement invoices will include the legally required contract reference.",

Activate the source type for each French company code  \n   IMG → Cross-Application Components → SAP Document and Reporting Compliance → eDocument → Business Settings → Activate Source Type Documents for Company Code  \n   • Company Code  = FRxx  \n   • Source Type   = STLMT_INV  \n   • Active        = X  \n   (updates table EDOC_C_SOURCETYPE)\n\n2. Link the settlement document types to the French eDocument types  \n   IMG → … → Assign eDocument Type to Settlement Document Type  \n   • Settlement Doc.Type (LFART, e.g. 0S12, 0S14, Z###)  \n   • eDocument Type = FR_INV (invoice) or FR_CRN (credit note)  \n   (table EDOC_C_STLMT)\n\n3.

Country/process activation (cloud) or relevant SAP Notes (on-prem)  \n   • CBC/SSCUI “Activate Document and Reporting Compliance Features” – flag country FR.  \n   • Set interface version 1 for France EU eInvoice.  \n   • On-prem: import the composite OSS note that delivers STLMT_INV for France.\n\n5. Mandatory numbering / ODN (if not already done)  \n   • Maintain number ranges for eDocuments.  \n   • Define ODN prefix based on source type STLMT_INV and LFART.\n\n6. Transport and test  \n   • Post a settlement invoice (WB2R_SC or Fiori “Create Settlement Document”).  \n   • In app “Manage Electronic Documents” (F4850) or Tx EDOC_COCKPIT a new line appears with Source Type = STLMT_INV, Process = France EU eInvoice.  \n   • Action “Submit” builds the Peppol BIS 3.0 XML and hands it to the Peppol Exchange; monitor via AIF (/EDOC/*).\n\nB.

Activate the France DRC framework for the company code  \n   IMG → Cross-Application Components → SAP Document & Reporting Compliance → Activate Document and Reporting Compliance Features  \n   • Tick country FR for the relevant company code(s).\n\n2. Activate the required source-document types for the company code  \n   IMG → … → Activate Source Document Types for Company Code  \n   • Mark at least the following for each French company code  \n     – FI_INVOICE (Accounting Document) – normally already active  \n     – STLMT_INV  (S4_SCM_SD_CUST_SETTL = Settlement-Management customer documents) ← NEW  \n   • Save and transport.  \n   Result: when a settlement document is posted the framework will look for a mapping line.\n\n3. Map every settlement-management document type to a French eDocument type  \n   IMG → … → Assign eDocument Type to Settlement Document Type  \n   (view cluster VC_EDOC_SETTLTYPE or SSCUI in public cloud)  \n   • Choose “New Entries”.  \n   • For each settlement document type that can be issued in France (0S**, ZS**, …) enter  \n       Settlement DocType | eDocument Type  \n       0S12               | FR_CRE  (Credit Note)  \n       0S16               | FR_INV  (Invoice)  \n       …                  | …  \n   • Save and transport.  \n   This single table line is what tells DRC to create a French eDocument when a settlement document of that type is posted.\n\n4. Make sure the generic DRC prerequisites for France are fulfilled  \n   – Maintain eDocument number ranges (IMG → Maintain Number Ranges for eDocuments).  \n   – Assign output form for PDF creation if needed (Specify Output Form).  \n   – Maintain VAT registration numbers, partner tax numbers, etc.\n\n5. (Optional) Enhance the XML/UBL mapping if the standard fields are not enough  \n   – BAdI EDOC_ADAPTER_SEL  → to influence which settlement docs get an eDocument.  \n   – BAdI EDOC_MAP_FR       → to add / change individual XML nodes for the French Chorus-Pro format.  \n   – Use the mapping workbench app “Define Mapping for eDocument Types” if you only need field-to-field adjustments (no coding).\n\n6. Test  \n   • Post a settlement document (e.g. WB2R_S).  \n   • Open Fiori app “eDocument Cockpit”.  \n   • A new entry with Source Object = Settlement Document and Type = FR_INV / FR_CRE should appear immediately in status “New”.  \n   • If nothing appears, re-check points 1-3 above (90 % of missing eDocuments are caused by an un-mapped or inactive source type).\n\nPlain-language summary  \nTurn on the France DRC switch, activate source type “Settlement Management Documents” (STLMT_INV) for your company code, map every French settlement document type to a French eDocument type (FR_INV/FR_CRE, etc.), and the system will automatically create French eInvoices/Credit Notes when you post settlement-management documents; enhance the mapping only if you need custom fields.",

         "Technical explanation (root cause and fix)\n1. What the tools show  \n   • sap_documentation_summary → 401 / 403 “Unauthorized” appears both when EDOC_COCKPIT submits an invoice and when SOAMANAGER → Ping Web Service is executed. This happens if the client-certificate or OAuth authentication is not set up correctly.  \n   • edp_troubleshooting_search → identical symptoms are listed in topic E23; solution is to “review the certificate settings of STRUST” and “create the logical port in SOAMANAGER with the correct certificate”.  \n   • sap_help_lookup → detailed breakdown of the 401 error: the TLS handshake is OK, but the cloud application rejects the request because either no client certificate is sent or the one sent does not match the certificate that is stored against the Communication User in SAP Document & Reporting Compliance, Cloud Edition (DRC CE).\n\n2. Why the calls fail  \n   • Backend (on-prem ERP / S/4HANA) logical port is configured for “X.509 SSL Client Certificate”, yet the ICM either sends no certificate or the wrong one.  \n   • Cloud side therefore cannot map the technical user and returns HTTP 401 / 403, which surfaces as “login failed” in EDOC_COCKPIT and as “Web-service ping failed (RC = 401)” in SOAMANAGER.\n\n3. Checklist to resolve (taken directly from sap_help_lookup section 9 and documentation summary)  \n   Cloud (DRC CE)  \n   ☐ App “Maintain Communication Users”: upload the same client certificate that lives in the backend SSL Client PSE.  \n   ☐ App “Communication Arrangements”: set Authentication = “Client Certificate” and reference the user above.  \n\n   Backend (on-prem)  \n   ☐ STRUST: make sure the SSL Client PSE that contains the private key of the certificate is valid (not expired).  \n   ☐ SOAMANAGER → Logical Port → Consumer Security:  \n        – Authentication = “X.509 SSL Client Certificate”  \n        – SSL Client PSE = the PSE that contains the certificate (not “Anonymous SSL”).  \n   ☐ STRUST: root / intermediate CAs of the cloud endpoint are present (see SAP Note 2801396).  \n   ☐ If you use a dedicated PSE, set profile parameter icm/HTTPS/client_pse accordingly.  \n\n4. How to verify  \n   • SMICM trace level 3: after Ping, confirm line “Client certificate sent (serial= …)”—if missing, the logical port points to the wrong PSE.  \n   • Cloud – Communication User: column “Last Logon” should update after a successful ping.  \n\n5. Result  \n   After the correct certificate is mapped on both sides and the logical port uses the matching PSE, SOAMANAGER Ping returns HTTP 200 and EDOC_COCKPIT sends invoices without any login prompt.\n\nPlain-language takeaway  \n“Backend cannot log on because it is either not sending a client certificate at all or it sends one the cloud system does not recognise. Upload the same certificate to the cloud Communication User and make sure the logical port in SOAMANAGER uses that certificate’s PSE; the 401 error disappears.”",

         "Technical explanation  \n• In SAP Document & Reporting Compliance the sender of a Peppol (or other e-document) message is uniquely identified by the tuple  \n  [Company Code] + [Party-ID Type] + [Party-ID].  \n• The customizing view “Assign Party ID Types to Companies” (table/view EDOC_C_CO_PRTY) therefore accepts only ONE record per Party-ID type in each company code.  \n• When the Party-ID type is “VAT”, the actual value that is sent is read from field STCEG (VAT Registration No.) in the company-code master data (T001).  \n• Trying to create a second line with the same VAT number—whether in another client or in another logical system—violates the unique-key check and the system raises the duplicate-VAT/participant-ID error observed (see SAP Note 2926868, tool-output [1]).  \n\nWhat this means for your landscape (one S/4 HANA system + one IS-U system, same legal entities)  \n1. Keep only ONE VAT participant record per company code.  \n   – Maintain the VAT once in OBY6.  \n   – Keep a single line in EDOC_C_CO_PRTY with Party-ID Type = “VAT”.  \n2. Route the document to the correct backend by communication settings, not by creating a second VAT entry.  \n   – Define separate “Communication Destinations” in the DRC customizing (views EDOC_C_COMSYS / EDOC_C_DEST) for S/4 HANA and for IS-U.  \n   – Link the appropriate destination to each client/system.  \n   – The cloud service will look up the company code by VAT, then forward the XML to the destination that matches the sending system.  \n3. If you really must transmit with two different identifiers, choose a different Party-ID type for the second system (e.g. GLN, Leitweg-ID) or implement BAdI EDOC_PARTY_ID to switch the identifier at runtime. A second static VAT number for the same legal entity is technically impossible.  \n\nIllustrative snippet (customizing)  \nCompany Code  | Party-ID Type | Value source  \n--------------|---------------|--------------  \n1000          | VAT           | STCEG = DE123456789  \n1000          | GLN           | EDOC_PRTID_CO entry = 4000001234568    ← could be used by IS-U if needed  \n\nPlain-language summary  \nYou cannot register the same VAT number twice; keep a single VAT participant entry for the company code and steer whether the XML goes to S/4 HANA or IS-U purely with the “Communication Destination” settings (or by a BAdI), not by duplicating the VAT ID.",

How the role is assigned (from SAP-help lookup)  \n   Global Account Administrator ➝ open target sub-account ➝ Security ► Administrators (or Members) ➝ Add ► User ➝ enter S-user / e-mail ➝ tick “Subaccount Administrator” ➝ Save.\n\n3. Where to upload the P9Q certificate (from SAP documentation summary)  \n   Sub-account cockpit ➝ Connectivity ► Destinations ➝ tab Certificates ➝ Upload Certificate ➝ select the PEM/P12 file ➝ Open.  \n   • If you create a Service Binding instead: paste the whole PEM-encoded X.509 certificate into field “User-Provided X.509 Certificate” (no extra blanks).\n\n4. Typical sequence for Peppol Cloud binding  \n   Test sub-account ( 8c0d… ) → upload the P9Q certificate → create / update the destination or service binding used by the “dcseupeppol…” test URL.  \n   Production sub-account ( 8dc6… ) → repeat the same steps.  \n   No change is required inside the Peppol Cloud dashboards themselves.\n\nPlain-language takeaway  \nAsk an existing BTP cockpit administrator to make you “Subaccount Administrator” for both Neo sub-accounts; afterwards you can open Connectivity → Certificates and upload the P9Q certificate needed by Peppol Cloud.",

         "Technical explanation  \n1. How the value is filled  \n   • For Malaysian import invoices DRC looks for the reference number of the customs form in the PO header text that carries text-type IMPORT_TEXT_TYPE (for cloud) or Header Text (F01) in ECC/S-4.  \n   • Your own enhancement combines MIGO + PO logic. If IMPORT_TEXT_TYPE is empty the routine still returns the PO-header string that happened to contain control characters (line-feeds, “/”, “–”, etc.).  \n   • During XML creation the framework validates field ReferenceNumberCustomsForm against the Malaysia e-invoice XSD. Only the characters [A-Z a-z 0-9] are allowed. A single disallowed character triggers error EDOCUMENT_MY 079 “special characters are not allowed …”, which prevents PDF/XML rendering.\n\n2. Why you see the error although “we did not maintain the text”  \n   • The text element itself is empty, but SAPscript stores an invisible carriage-return (hex 0D) when a header-text line was once created and later deleted.  \n   • Your BAdI‐implementation copies that control character to the eDocument; the validator then rejects it as “special character”.\n\n3. Fix / mitigation  \n   A. Master-data / process  \n      – Maintain the correct 18-digit customs form number (digits only) in PO-header, text type IMPORT_TEXT_TYPE, before running MIRO.  \n      – Or leave the field completely blank; delete the header text line so no control character is saved (Menu: Header → Texts → Delete line, then save).  \n   B. Code adjustment (recommended so the interface is robust)  \n      Implement a short clean-up in your BAdI class (e.g. EDOC_ADAPTOR→SET_OUTPUT_DATA):  \n      ```abap\n      DATA(lv_ref) = condense( cl_abap_char_utilities=>remove_non_printable( iv_ref_no ) ).\n      REPLACE ALL OCCURRENCES OF REGEX '[^A-Za-z0-9]' IN lv_ref WITH ''.   \"strip specials\n      ev_ref_no = lv_ref.\n      ```  \n      This removes both control characters and visible punctuation before the value is passed to DRC.  \n   C. Validation exit (if you prefer to block instead of auto-clean)  \n      – Activate BAdI DRC_GOV_FORMS_VALIDATE and raise an error when `iv_ref_no CP '*[^A-Za-z0-9]*'`. The user then gets an on-screen message at MIRO.\n\n4. Where to check in the log  \n   • Transaction SLG1, Object = EDOCUMENT_MYS, Subobject = EDOC_PROC → double-click the entry to see the exact offending character position.\n\nPlain-language summary  \nThe customs-form number that DRC picks up from the PO header secretly contains a control or punctuation character; the Malaysia e-invoice schema accepts only letters and digits, so the PDF/XML is rejected. Either store a clean 18-digit number in the PO text or add a small ABAP cleanup that strips non-alphanumerics before DRC is called.",

         "Technical explanation (key facts confirmed by SAP-Help and SAP-Note lookup)\n\n1.  The jump from “Malaysia e-Invoice v1.0” to “v1.1” is delivered in ONE composite SAP Note under component CA-GTF-CSC-EDO-MY.  \n    •  Current composite‐note number: SAP Note 3521693 – “eDocument Malaysia: Composite Note (Version 1.1)”  \n       – Latest version: 04 (or higher – always pull the newest version in SNOTE).  \n       – Software logistics: contains transport requests that update DDIC objects, value-mapping views and program corrections.  \n\n2.  Other delta Notes that the composite pulls in or requires (already contained or listed as prerequisites):  \n    •  3481491 – XML mapping + PDF header/issuer enhancements (v1.1 schema “PINT 1.1”).  \n    •  3487081 – UBL 2.3 upload interface for invoices created outside SAP.  \n    •  3510880 – Buyer-issued tax invoices without tax codes (tax category 06 “N/A”).  \n\n3.  New/changed technical objects supplied by the composite update  \n    •  Four additional value-mapping objects in table/view EDO_COCKPIT_VMAP  \n      – MY_SENDER_REG_ID, MY_MATERIAL_CLASSIF, MY_MATGRP_CLASSIF, MY_ACCOUNT_CLASSIF  \n    •  Extended mapping view MY_TAX_MAP for exempt/zero-rate scenarios.  \n    •  Cockpit tables EDOC_COCKPIT_HDR / ITM enhanced (fields for “NA” handling of legacy credit/debit notes).  \n\n4.  Manual activities after you import SAP Note 3521693  \n    ① Load company-wide Sender Registration ID in value mapping MY_SENDER_REG_ID.  \n    ② Maintain new classification-code value mappings (material, material group, G/L).  \n    ③ Update Business Partner master with Peppol Party ID (ID Type PAP001) if you intend to send cleared invoices via the Peppol channel introduced in v1.1.  \n    ④ For historical correction documents fill field “Original IRBM UID” with value ‘NA’ before submission.  \n    ⑤ Upload the single P12 certificate that relates to the mapped Sender Registration ID in the cloud-edition Communication Settings app.  \n\n5.  No change to XSD or API names – the XML continues to follow IRBM “PINT 1.1”; all BAdIs in namespace EDO_MAL* remain valid.  \n\nPlain-language one-liner  \nInstall SAP Note 3521693 (latest version) in your ERP/S-4 system, carry out the short configuration steps above, and you will have upgraded Malaysia e-Invoice processing from release 1.0 to the new 1.1 legal requirements.",

         "Technical explanation  \n• SAP Document & Reporting Compliance for Malaysia reads the tax‐number parameters that you maintain in OBY6 → Additional Data.  \n• For Tourism-Tax the system looks specifically for parameter key MY_TTR (Tourism-Tax Registration Number).  \n• During XML build the value of MY_TTR is copied to element  \n  <n1:AccountingSupplierParty><cac:PartyTaxScheme><cbc:CompanyID schemeID=\"TTR\">…</cbc:CompanyID>  \n• If MY_TTR is empty or contains “NA”, the framework suppresses the element, so the resulting XML violates IRBM validation rules when your company is expected to show a tourism-tax number.  \n• The behaviour is standard; no SAP note is required unless you miss the latest mapping corrections (see SAP Note 3487313).\n\nWhat to do  \n1. OBY6 → Company Code → Additional Data  \n   – Create a new line with Parameter Type MY_TTR and enter the real tourism-tax registration number issued by MOTAC.  \n   – Do NOT use “NA” or leave the field blank.  \n2. Save and re-generate the eDocument (EDOC_COCKPIT → Recreate XML).  \n3. Open “Display XML” – you should now find the fragment:  \n\n   <cac:PartyTaxScheme>  \n     <cbc:CompanyID schemeID=\"TTR\">TT-123456-78901</cbc:CompanyID>  \n   </cac:PartyTaxScheme>  \n\n4. Submit again; the validation error disappears.  \n5. If your business is not subject to tourism tax, ask IRBM whether the element may be omitted; otherwise register and maintain a valid number.\n\nOne-sentence summary  \nEnter the actual tourism-tax registration number (parameter MY_TTR) instead of “NA” in OBY6 – once populated, the Tourism-Tax node is automatically generated in the Malaysia eInvoice XML and the validation error is resolved.",

A NEW eDocument line should now appear; process it in EDOC_COCKPIT or Fiori “Manage Electronic Documents”.\n\nTypical implementation lapses observed after the Note import  \n\n• Mapping still uses eDoc type MY_CRE (meant for FI manual credit memos), not MY_CRESF.  \n• Customer created a Z-document type instead of KG and forgot to map it.  \n• The “Activate Additional eDocument Instance Creation” entry was lost in the import client.  \n• Users posted MIRO with “Credit Memo” radio button (mapped to MY_DEBSF), but checked the mapping only for “Subsequent Credit”.\n\nOnce the four SSCUI entries are complete, every new MIRO Subsequent Credit will automatically create the eDocument and the XML enhancements provided by SAP Notes 3496530/3496562 will be applied.\n\nPlain-language summary  \nThe recent SAP Notes did not stop eDocument creation—the required mapping for MIRO “Subsequent Credit” (eDoc type MY_CRESF) is missing or got overwritten. Add the four IMG entries above, repost the credit note, and the Malaysian eDocument will be created again.",

         "The generated answer is partially helpful in addressing the user's question and the issues mentioned in the expert answer. Here's why:\n\n1. Currency Code Issue:\n   - The generated answer correctly identifies that the currency code (CurrencyID) in the XML should come from the document currency field (WAERK/WAERS) and suggests possible reasons for the discrepancy (wrong posting or BAdI implementation).\n   - However, it doesn't directly address why the plant code is showing instead of the currency code, which was the user's primary question.\n\n2. Tax Exemption Error:\n   - The answer correctly identifies and explains the CF366 error (\"Tax exemption reason is required\") mentioned in the expert answer.\n   - It provides detailed steps to fix this issue, including customizing value mapping, supplying the reason in the source document, and rebuilding/resubmitting the document.\n\n3. Alignment with SAP Documentation:\n   - The answer aligns well with the SAP documentation summary provided by the tool, especially regarding the importance of tax exemption reasons and the need to enter them in specific fields.\n\n4. Completeness:\n   - The answer provides a comprehensive explanation of both issues (currency code and tax exemption), going beyond the initial question.\n   - It includes a checklist and a plain-language summary, which are helpful for users.\n\n5. Areas for Improvement:\n   - The answer could have been more focused on the specific question about the currency code showing as a plant code.\n   - It doesn't mention the MYR currency code that the expert answer notes is correctly appearing in the XML.\n\nIn conclusion, while the generated answer is informative and provides valuable troubleshooting steps, it doesn't fully address the user's specific question about the currency code showing as a plant code.

         "Technical explanation  \n1. Wrong value in XML node cbc:CurrencyID  \n   • CurrencyID is filled automatically by the SAP Document & Reporting Compliance mapping class from the document-currency field (WAERK/WAERS).  \n   • There is no value-mapping object for currency, therefore the only ways it can turn into a “plant code” are:  \n     – The source document itself was posted with that value in WAERK.  \n     – A customer BAdI implementation (EDOC_ADAPTOR_MAPPER or similar) overwrote structure EDOC_MY_INV-CURR_ID at runtime.  \n   • What to do  \n     ① Display the original FI/SD document (BKPF–WAERS, VBRK–WAERK). If the currency is already wrong, correct the master data and repost.  \n     ② If WAERK is correct there, debug or temporarily deactivate your BAdI; rebuild the XML with report EDOC_ADAPTOR_XML_REBUILD and check again.  \n     ③ No value mapping is involved, so nothing has to be maintained in app “Configure Value Mapping”.  \n\n2. Submission error CF366 “Tax exemption reason is required”  \n   • At least one line in the e-Invoice has TaxType = E (Tax-exempt) mapped via value mapping object MY_TAX_MAP, but the framework cannot find a TaxExemptionReason text → hard error CF366.  \n   • Fix consists of TWO parts:\n\n     a) Customizing / value mapping  \n        – Map every tax-exempt tax code you use (e.g. Z0, L0) to code E in value mapping “Malaysia – Tax Type (MY_TAX_MAP)”.  \n        – In CBC/SSCUI “Text Type for Tax Exemption Reason (EXEMPT_TEXT_TYPE)” enter the text type you will use (0001 for SD, F01 for MM self-billing, etc.).\n\n     b) Supplying the reason in the source document  \n        • SD Billing: VF01/VF04 → item ► “Item Texts” ► text type 0001; enter the reason (≤ 255 chars).  \n        • FI Invoice (FB70/FB75): customer line ► field BSEG-SGTXT.  \n        • MM Self-billing (buyer-issued): PO item ► text type F01; in MIRO-Advanced pick the exempt tax code.  \n        • Convergent Invoicing: Provider contract ► External Reference type 5040.  \n        • FI-CA Sales Billing: same as SD (item text 0001).\n\n     c) Rebuild & resubmit  \n        – After you correct the text or customizing, run report EDOC_ADAPTOR_XML_REBUILD, then resubmit in EDOC_COCKPIT or app “Manage Electronic Documents”.  \n        – In cockpit choose Goto → History → File → XML_REQUEST to verify that <TaxExemptionReason> is now present.\n\nQuick checklist  \n☐ Document currency (WAERK/WAERS) correct?  \n☐ No BAdI overwriting CURR_ID?  \n☐ Tax-exempt tax codes mapped to E in MY_TAX_MAP?  \n☐ Text type for exemption reason configured (EXEMPT_TEXT_TYPE)?  \n☐ Reason text maintained in every exempt item line?  \n☐ XML rebuilt after the corrections?\n\nPlain-language summary  \nCurrency in the XML comes straight from the invoice header; if it shows a plant code, either the invoice was posted with that value or custom code changed it—fix the posting or the BAdI.  \nThe CF366 error means you picked an “exempt” tax code but did not give a reason; map the exempt tax code correctly and enter the exemption reason text on each item, then rebuild and resend the e-Invoice.",

When the eDocument framework reads a Settlement-Management document (`source_type = 'STLMT_INV'`) it already simulates an SD billing header/item (VBRK/VBRP). Hence `is_vbrp-netwr` and `is_vbrp-fkimg` can be re-used.  \n2. For UBL/France B2B the unit-price may require shifting the decimal point if the number of decimals exceeds two. The logic therefore:  \n   • Extracts the fractional length  \n   • If more than two, multiplies by 10 / 100 / 1000 … and sets `ev_unit_quan` accordingly (100, 1 000 etc.).  \n3. `format_negative_amount` is a framework helper that re-applies the minus sign in compliance-friendly format.  \n4. Finally the document currency is copied from the simulated billing header.\n\nPlain-language summary:  \nCreate class CL_EDOC_MAP_FR_B2B_STLMT inheriting from the SD class, overwrite FILL_PRICE_AMOUNT as above, and the France B2B mapping will now correctly derive price and amount when the source document is a Settlement-Management invoice.",

         "Technical explanation (step-by-step)\n\n1. Define the new process in configuration  \n   • SSCUI “Define eDocument Process” (e.g. ZINV_OUT).  \n   • Maintain status catalogue, allowed transitions, start & end statuses.  \n\n2. Model every action that drives the status flow  \n   • In SSCUI “Define eDocument Action” list actions such as CREATE_FROM_HOOK, SUBMIT, SEND_TO_CUSTOMER, CANCEL, RESUBMIT, DELETE.  \n   • For each action assign a handler class that implements interface IF_EDOCUMENT_ACTION and specify next status for SUCCESS / ERROR and whether it is user-executable from Fiori cockpit apps.  \n\n3. Build the creation hook from the source document  \n   • Implement BAdI BADI_EDOC_CREATE (method GET_DATA/CHECK_RELEVANCE) to fill structure EDOCUMENT_DATA when an SD billing, FI posting, MM invoice, etc. is posted.  \n   • Framework stores the result in tables EDOCUMENT (header) / EDOCUMENT_ITEM (lines).  \n\n4. Map internal data to the required XML/UBL/Peppol payload  \n   • Implement BAdI EDOCUMENT_XML_MAP or interface IF_EDOCUMENT_EXT_ES; write XML to table EDOC_FILE (FILETYPE = ‘OUT’).  \n\n5. Configure and code the SUBMIT (outbound web-service) action  \n   • Re-use generic class CL_EDOC_SUBMIT_WS or create your own.  \n   • Maintain “Define eDocument Interface” customizing (logical port, communication scenario).  \n   • Action updates status sequence Created → Sent to Interface → Track-ID Received.  \n\n6. Persist and display the XML in the Fiori apps  \n   • Standard “Display XML” action reads EDOC_FILE; optional BAdI EDOCUMENT_UI_AUTH can extend the cockpit view.  \n\n7. Optional follow-up actions – e-mail, cancellation, status enquiry  \n   • Example: action SEND_TO_CUSTOMER calling CL_EDOC_SEND_EMAIL, linked to a BRF+ output template to mail PDF/XML to buyer.  \n   • Action CANCEL can block source-document reversal and call BAdI EDOCUMENT_CANCEL_DOC to inform the authority.  \n\n8. Activate the process for business users  \n   • In the Manage eDocument Process app, mark the custom process Active → it becomes selectable in Manage Electronic Documents.  \n\n9. Schedule mass jobs and monitor  \n   • Job template EDOC_PROC_SCHEDULER runs CREATE_FROM_HOOK and SUBMIT in batch.  \n   • Use AIF monitoring or the “Manage Electronic Documents” app to filter by Process Type Code, country, or Process Instance ID.  \n\n10. Secure & test  \n   • Assign role SAP_FIN_BC_EDOC_PC to developers/key users.  \n   • Unit-test mapping classes in ADT; no real web-service needed.  \n   • Keep coding within released Developer-Extensibility APIs to stay upgrade-safe in Public Cloud.\n\nMini-example of the central objects\n\n*Process definition (SSCUI 105060):*  \n  Process Key  ZINV_OUT  \n  Start Status CREATED  \n  End Status   SENT_TO_CUSTOMER\n\n*Action entry (SSCUI 105062):*  \n  Action       SUBMIT  \n  Handler      CL_EDOC_SUBMIT_WS  \n  Success →    SENT_TO_INTERFACE  \n  Error   →    ERROR_SUBMIT  \n  Manual Exec   Yes\n\nPlain-language summary  \nCreate a custom eDocument process by configuring statuses and actions, coding small BAdIs for data extraction, XML mapping and web-service submission, activating the process, then scheduling and monitoring it—all with upgrade-safe developer extensibility in SAP S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition.",

         "Technical explanation  \nIn method IS_RELEVANT of class CL_EDOCUMENT_FR_INV the list of “permitted” source-types is implemented by a single IF-statement that NEGATES every non-permitted value.  \nThe condition now also contains cl_edoc_source_stlmt=>gc_src_stlmt_inv.  \nBecause the checks are joined with AND and use “<>” (NOT-equal), the whole IF block is executed only when the incoming source type is different from ALL listed types; if that happens the routine sets rv_relevant = abap_false and RETURNS.  \nBy inserting the Settlement-Management constant into that list, the check fails (the IF is not true) whenever the source type equals gc_src_stlmt_inv – therefore the code continues, sets rv_relevant to abap_true and the document is treated as relevant, enabling eDocument creation and later mapping.\n\nRelevant code excerpt (taken directly from method IS_RELEVANT of CL_EDOCUMENT_FR_INV):\n\n```abap\nMETHOD is_relevant.\n\n  DATA lv_bukrs_land TYPE land1.\n\n  \">>> Allowed source types (NOT-equal checks)\n  IF  mo_source->mv_source_type <> cl_edoc_source_sd_invoice=>gc_src_sd_invoice\n  AND mo_source->mv_source_type <> cl_edoc_source_fi_invoice=>gc_src_fi_invoice\n  AND mo_source->mv_source_type <> cl_edoc_source_invoice_verif=>gc_src_inv_verif\n  AND mo_source->mv_source_type <> cl_edoc_source_stlmt=>gc_src_stlmt_inv   \"<<< NEW for Settlement Mgmt\n  AND mo_source->mv_source_type <> cl_edoc_source_ext_doc=>gc_src_ext_doc.  \"3428018\n      rv_relevant = abap_false.\n      RETURN.\n  ENDIF.\n\n  rv_relevant = abap_true.\n\n  \"Cancellation logic (unchanged) …\n  IF rv_relevant = abap_true.\n      IF mo_source->is_cancelled( ) = abap_true OR\n         mo_source->is_cancellation( ) = abap_true.\n         rv_relevant = abap_false.\n      ENDIF.\n  ENDIF.\n\n  \"Adaptor BAdI delegation …\n  IF mo_adaptor IS BOUND.\n      mo_adaptor->if_edoc_adaptor~is_relevant(\n         EXPORTING io_source   = mo_source\n         CHANGING  cx_relevant = rv_relevant ).\n  ENDIF.\n\nENDMETHOD.\n```\n\nWhat changed  \n• The extra line  \n  `AND mo_source->mv_source_type <> cl_edoc_source_stlmt=>gc_src_stlmt_inv`  \nadds the Settlement-Management source type to the list of “accepted” document origins.  \n• No further mapping changes are needed in this method; once rv_relevant stays TRUE the standard mapping classes will be called automatically.\n\nPlain-language summary  \nAdding one NOT-equal comparison for cl_edoc_source_stlmt=>gc_src_stlmt_inv to the IF block makes Settlement Management documents relevant for France e-Invoicing, so the system now creates and maps eDocuments for them.",

Activate the source-type for every French company code  \n   IMG path  \n     Cross-Application Components → Document and Reporting Compliance → Foundation Functions → Activate Source Type Documents for Company Code  \n   Table written: EDOSOURCEACT (on-premise: EDOSOURCEAC)  \n   Required entry  \n     Company Code | Source Type | Active  \n     FR01         | STLMT_INV  | X             (repeat for every FR company code)\n\n2. Tell DRC which eDocument type it shall create from each Settlement-Management document type  \n   IMG path  \n     Document and Reporting Compliance → Country/Region-Specific Functions → France → Assign eDocument Type to Settlement Document Type  \n   Table written: EDODC_STLMT_TY  \n   Example mapping (adjust to the document types you actually use)  \n     Settlement Mgmt DocType | Country | eDocument Type  \n     0S12 (Cust.

         "Technical explanation  \n1. What the status means  \n   “Received by sender access point” = the file made it to SAP’s Peppol Sender AP, but the AP could not push it to your on-premise / S-4 backend.  \n   The Document Monitor shows HTTP-401 “Unauthorized”, so the Peppol cloud service tried to call the inbound SOAP service that your Cloud Connector exposes and the backend rejected the call.  \n\n2. Root cause indicated by 401 + “Anmeldung fehlgeschlagen”  \n   • Wrong or locked communication user in the backend that is named in Peppol Exchange > Connection Management (“User” column).  \n   • Password in the BTP destination or in Connection Management does not match the backend user.  \n   • Missing authorisations for that user (typical objects: S_SERVICE, S_SRT_MONI, S_EDOC*).  \n   • Cloud Connector mapping mismatch (host name or Location ID differs from what is stored in Connection Management).  \n\n3. Quick checks  \n   a. In the backend, run SU01 for the user shown in Connection Management → verify “Locked” flag and reset the password if necessary.  \n   b. Execute SU53 immediately after a failed push (or ST01 trace) to see the exact authorisation objects that were denied.  \n   c. In a browser open:  \n      https://<internal-host>:<port>/sap/bc/srt/xip/edocument/peppol_inbound (or the exact service path you expose)  \n      Log on with the same user/pass that Connection Management uses. If you also receive 401 here, the fault is confirmed on the backend side.  \n   d. Cloud Connector → check Subaccount, Location ID and virtual host/port. They must be identical to the values maintained in Peppol Exchange > Connection Management.  \n\n4. Remediation steps (ordered)  \n   1) Unlock backend user and/or synchronise its password with the one stored in Connection Management.  \n   2) Assign missing roles: at minimum include S_SERVICE (value: /EDO/PEPPOL*), S_EDOC_RT, S_EDOC_CC, S_SRT_MONI, and any company-specific authorisations mentioned in note 2949379.  \n   3) If using a client certificate, delete and re-upload the certificate in Connection Management and SOAMANAGER, making sure CN and validity are correct.  \n   4) Test connectivity from Cloud Connector (“Check availability”) and from Peppol Exchange dashboard (“Test connection”). Both must return HTTP-200.  \n   5) Re-process the stuck document from eDocument Cockpit (EDOC_COCKPIT) → “Restart Processing”.  \n\n5. SAP Notes / guides to confirm implementation  \n   • 2949379 – eDoc Peppol Configuration and Customizing (manual post-steps & roles)  \n   • 2914302 – Length increase for partner IDs (if push fails only for specific receivers)  \n   • 2932677 – Email process corrections (if you use e-mail mode)  \n   • 2783795 – Peppol installation overview (country notes)  \n\nExample  \nSU53 after failed push shows:  \nAuthorization check failed  \nObject: S_SERVICE  \nService: /EDO/PEPPOL_RECEIVE  \nActivity: 16 (Execute)  \n→ Add this object to the role of the communication user and restart the document.  \n\nPlain-language summary  \nThe Peppol cloud service cannot log on to your backend, so fix the backend user/password or authorisations (and ensure Cloud Connector settings match); once the connection returns HTTP-200, restart the document and it will leave the “Received by sender access point” status.",

         "Technical explanation  \n1. What the certificate is  \n  • For the “Communication User” you create in SAP S/4HANA Cloud you must store the PUBLIC key of the system that will call your tenant (inbound mutual-TLS).  \n  • In the Peppol scenario that is either  \n    – the certificate issued to your own SAP BTP Peppol Exchange service key, or  \n    – the certificate provided by the external Peppol Access-Point operator you work with.  \n  • It is a standard X.509 certificate, public part only, no private key.\n\n2. Where to obtain it  \n  a) If you use SAP Peppol Exchange on SAP BTP  \n    1. In SAP BTP Cockpit create the Connectivity-Service instance (plan = connectivity_proxy).  \n    2. Create a Service Key with credential-type “x509”.  \n    3. The JSON that is returned contains a field  \n      \"certificate\": \"-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE----- … -----END CERTIFICATE-----\"  \n    4. Copy everything between and including the BEGIN/END lines into a text file (name-suffix .pem, .crt or .cer).  \n  b) If you use another Peppol Access Point  \n    Ask the operator for their client certificate in PEM/Base-64 format; most APs will email the file or provide a download link.\n\n3. File format accepted by S/4HANA Cloud  \n  • Base-64-encoded X.509, extensions .pem, .crt or .cer.  \n  • Contents must start with  \n    -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----  \n    …base64…  \n    -----END CERTIFICATE-----  \n  • Only the public certificate is uploaded; the private key stays with the Access Point / BTP service-key and never enters S/4HANA Cloud.\n\n4. Upload steps in the Fiori apps  \n  1. Open app “Maintain Communication Users” (F2541).  \n  2. Create or edit the user you plan to assign to the Peppol Communication Arrangement.  \n  3. Tab “Certificates” → Add → “Upload Certificate” → browse to the .pem/.crt file → Save.  \n  4. Later, in “Communication Systems” choose this user and set Authentication Method = “Client Certificate”.\n\n5. Typical outbound certificate confusion  \n  • The certificate you download from “Maintain Client Certificates” (Default Client Certificate) is used in the opposite direction (your S/4HANA Cloud → Peppol).  \n  • That one must be given to the Access-Point so they trust calls coming from you; it is NOT the file you upload to the Communication User.\n\n6. Renewal / rotation  \n  • Watch the “Valid To” date shown after upload.  \n  • Replace the file before expiry; simply upload the successor certificate and save.\n\nShort example  \n# File you receive from Peppol AP or BTP service key  \n-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----  \nMIIFdzCCA1+gAwIBAgIQe1…kJZ  \n…  \n-----END CERTIFICATE-----\n\nUpload that file to the Communication User.\n\nPlain-language summary  \nAsk the Peppol service that will call your S/4HANA Cloud (either your own SAP BTP Peppol Exchange service key or an external Access Point) for their X.509 client certificate, save it as a .pem/.crt text file, and upload it to the Communication User; SAP only needs the public certificate, in standard Base-64 format.",

Consistency with Tool Output: The generated answer is mostly consistent with the tool's output, particularly regarding the ZUGFeRD format support and the ability to handle PDF files. However, it doesn't mention the mass download functionality for Italy Incoming eInvoices, which could be relevant.\n\nIn conclusion, while the generated answer provides valuable and detailed information that addresses the core of the question, it misses some important points from the expert answer and doesn't fully leverage all the information provided by the tool. Therefore, it is classified as \"Partially Helpful.\"",

         "Technical explanation  \n1. How the cockpit decides which “display” buttons to show  \n   • When an incoming XML is converted into an eDocument, class CL_EDOC_XML_PARSER looks for the segment  \n     `<cac:AdditionalDocumentReference>` (Peppol/UBL) or the equivalent ZUGFeRD element.  \n   • If it finds a child element that contains either  \n       – `cbc:EmbeddedDocumentBinaryObject` (base-64 of the file) or  \n       – `cac:ExternalReference/cbc:URI` (link to the file)  \n     the parser writes a header line to table EDOC_ADOC_REF and the binary (or URL) to table EDOC_ADOC_REF_B.  \n   • At runtime the cockpit UI (method CL_EDOC_UI_ATTACHMENT→SHOW_ATTACHMENTS) checks EDOC_ADOC_REF.  \n     – If at least one entry is present, the toolbar icon “Display Attachments” becomes active.  \n     – If only the HTML surrogate (mimeCode text/html) is stored, the “Display HTML” button alone is enabled.  \n     – If a PDF is stored (mimeCode application/pdf) the “Display Attachments” icon opens a pop-up that lists the PDF, which the user can click to view in the browser.\n\n2. What to change in your push logic  \n   • Besides sending the HTML you already create, embed the original PDF in the same AdditionalDocumentReference block, e.g.  \n\n     <cac:AdditionalDocumentReference>  \n        <cbc:ID>ORIGINAL_PDF</cbc:ID>  \n        <cbc:DocumentType>application/pdf</cbc:DocumentType>  \n        <cbc:DocumentTypeCode>916</cbc:DocumentTypeCode>   <!-- optional -->  \n        <cbc:FileName>Invoice 4711.pdf</cbc:FileName>  \n        <cbc:EmbeddedDocumentBinaryObject mimeCode=\"application/pdf\" filename=\"Invoice 4711.pdf\">  \n          (base-64 of the PDF…)  \n        </cbc:EmbeddedDocumentBinaryObject>  \n     </cac:AdditionalDocumentReference>\n\n   • Or, if the file is big, supply only a URL:\n\n     <cac:ExternalReference><cbc:URI>https://…/Invoice 4711.pdf</cbc:URI></cac:ExternalReference>\n\n3. No extra customizing is required  \n   • The attachment button is data-driven; as soon as EDOC_ADOC_REF contains a line with MIME = application/pdf the button is shown.  \n   • Make sure your SAP release is on a recent SP of the eDocument Framework (note 3024383 fixed an issue where the button was not refreshed for incoming documents).\n\n4. Where to verify  \n   • After the PUSH call succeeds, check table EDOC_ADOC_REF (SE16/SE16N) for the created eDocument number.  \n   • Field MIME_TYPE should read ‘APPLICATION/PDF’ and GUID should link to EDOC_ADOC_REF_B.  \n   • Open the eDocument Cockpit → select the document → the toolbar now shows the icon “Display Attachments”.  \n     Clicking it opens a list containing “Invoice 4711.pdf” that can be viewed or downloaded.\n\nPlain-language summary  \nPut the original ZUGFeRD PDF into the XML’s AdditionalDocumentReference; the cockpit will recognise it automatically and light up a “Display Attachments” icon so users can open the PDF next to the HTML view.",

Communication User  \n   • Fiori app “Maintain Communication Users” (or SU01).  \n   • Create a technical user or upload an X.509 certificate that the external system will use.\n\n2. Communication System = Logical System ID (Inbound Only)  \n   • Fiori app “Communication Systems”  → New.  \n   • System ID = logical system name that will also appear in bgRFC and partner profiles.  \n   • In tab General → set Direction = “Inbound Only”.  \n   • Assign the communication user created in step 1.\n\n3. Communication Arrangement for the e-Document scenario  \n   • Fiori app “Communication Arrangements” → New.  \n   • Enter the scenario ID that delivers the inbound web service (e.g. SAP_COM_0863 for generic e-Invoicing or a country-specific EDOC_* ID).  \n   • Reference the Communication System from step 2.  \n   • The arrangement auto-generates:  \n     – An HTTPS/SOAP endpoint (ICF node) that you give to the external system.  \n     – A bgRFC destination of type “W” with the same name as the logical system.\n\n4. Activate HTTP service & open Cloud Connector path  \n   • The ICF node created above must be active (done automatically in most releases; otherwise activate in SICF).  \n   • In SAP BTP Cloud Connector map the ICF path (e.g. /sap/bc/srt) to make it reachable from the cloud side.\n\n5. bgRFC configuration and destination mapping  \n   • Transaction SBGRFCCONF or Fiori app “Monitor bgRFC Queues” shows the destination that was generated (same ID as in step 2).  \n   • Make sure a separate inbound destination exists for each application to avoid queue name collisions.  \n   • If queues must be rerouted later, use “Destination mapping” in the same app or report BGRFC_DESTINATION_MAINTAIN.\n\n6. Enable SAP Application Interface Framework (AIF) monitoring (optional but recommended)  \n   • Activate the AIF namespace delivered with SAP Document and Reporting Compliance so that interface errors can be monitored/restarted in Fiori app “Interface Monitor”.\n\n7. Populate “Manage Destination Mappings – Outgoing” (cloud edition side)  \n   • Source ID = logical system ID from step 2.  \n   • Target = your S/4HANA Private Cloud tenant.  \n   • This links the external communication party to the inbound queue in your system.\n\n8. Verify connectivity  \n   • External system sends a test call to the URL from step 3.  \n   • Use Fiori app “Display Connectivity Trace” or SBGRFCMON to confirm that the message reached your bgRFC queue.  \n\nPlain-language summary  \nCreate an inbound-only communication system with a technical user, link it to the country-specific e-Document communication arrangement, activate/route the generated HTTPS service through Cloud Connector, and make sure the automatically created bgRFC destination is visible in “Monitor bgRFC Queues”.

The database anchor  \n   • Stored in core tables EDOC_HEADER / EDOC_STATUS and in the custom-type table EDOC_TYPEC.  \n   • Referenced by every follow-on customizing activity and BAdI implementation.\n\n2. The trigger link from source documents  \n   • Nodes such as “Assign eDocument Type to Billing/Accounting/PO Document Type” require you to choose an eDocument type.  \n   • When a source document that carries this assignment is posted, the factory class for your new process is called and the correct eDocument instance is created.\n\n3. The routing switch to the cloud service  \n   • Activity “Define Process Communication Through Cloud Services” is (Company Code + eDocument Process + eDocument Type).  \n   • Without your own type you cannot flag the documents for Cloud Edition routing and metering.\n\n4. The lifecycle controller  \n   • Cancellation rules, deletion logic and XML-display BAdIs (IF_EDOCUMENT_EXT_ES, EDOCUMENT_INT_CONN_EXT) are activated per eDocument type.\n\n5. The status/analytics key in Fiori “Manage Electronic Documents” (App ID F4306)  \n   • Custom status mapping, colour coding, filters and mass actions are stored per eDocument type.\n\n6. A protection layer against SAP content updates and licence metering  \n   • SAP delivers new content only for SAP-delivered types; custom types prevent overwrites.  \n   • Metering for on-premise runtime engines counts by eDocument type, so custom cloud-routed types avoid wrong licence consumption.\n\nMini checklist to create a New Process in public cloud  \n1. Fiori app “Manage eDocument Process” → Create Process with new eDocument Type (Zxx) and assign data-provider/factory classes.  \n2. SSC-UI configuration:  \n   • Activate source document types for CoCd.  \n   • Assign eDocument Type to source documents.  \n   • Define Process Communication Through Cloud Services.  \n   • Optional PO-state relevance, error categories, XML field mapping.  \n3. Implement required BAdIs (IF_EDOCUMENT_EXT_ES, EDOCUMENT_INT_CONN_EXT).  \n4. Test and monitor in “Manage Electronic Documents”.\n\nPlain-language summary  \nYou need a new eDocument type because it is the unique ID that ties your custom process to every part of DRC—triggering, sending, status tracking, and lifecycle handling; without it, the system cannot recognise or manage your custom electronic documents.",

         "Technical explanation  \nTo register a completely new electronic-document process in SAP Document and Reporting Compliance (DRC) – Public Cloud, SAP requires exactly three enhancement points to be filled.  All three belong to the eDocument Extensibility framework and are referenced throughout the official help and implementation guide (see tool excerpts).\n\n1. BAdI EDOCUMENT_BASE_EXT  \n   • Enhancement spot: ES_EDOCUMENT_EXT  \n   • Purpose: tells the framework “which process is this?”  \n     – You set the eDocument class, eDocument type and process version that will be created when a source document (e.g. SD invoice) is saved.  \n   • Filter: country/region (and optionally source-type).\n\n2. BAdI EDOC_ADAPTOR_CLOUD  \n   • Enhancement spot: ES_DOCUMENT_CLOUD  \n   • Purpose: mapping & creation logic.  \n     – Here you can veto document creation or add/change fields in the generic mapping structure that is converted to XML/UBL/Peppol, etc.  \n   • Typical use: add industry-specific tags, enrich XML, block zero-value invoices, etc.  \n   • Filter: country/region or any generic key of your choice.\n\n3. BAdI EDOCUMENT_INT_CONN_EXT  \n   • Enhancement spot: ES_EDOCUMENT_EXT (same spot as the base class)  \n   • Purpose: communication handler.  \n     – Supplies payload to Integration Suite/AIF or RFC, receives response, updates status.  \n   • You write method IF_EDOCUMENT_INT_CONN_EXT~GET_SOURCE_DATA (and others) to transform your internal structure into the “generic mapping source” expected by the framework.\n\nWhy only these three?  \nThe official “DRC Extensibility – Public Cloud” guide (tool refs #sap_documentation_summary 8 & 9) explicitly states:  \n\n• “There are three mandatory BAdIs to be implemented for a new process: EDOCUMENT_BASE_EXT, EDOC_ADAPTOR_CLOUD, EDOCUMENT_INT_CONN_EXT.”  \n\nImplementations are called in this sequence during runtime:  \n1. EDOCUMENT_BASE_EXT → decides process & returns handler class  \n2. EDOC_ADAPTOR_CLOUD → adapts mapping / can cancel processing  \n3. EDOCUMENT_INT_CONN_EXT → sends data out & handles reply\n\nOnce all three are active (with proper filters) the new process appears in Process Manager, can be selected in the cockpit, and full end-to-end submission works.\n\nCode snippet outline (abbreviated):\n\n```\nCLASS zcl_my_country_base DEFINITION\n  PUBLIC FINAL CREATE PUBLIC.\n  PUBLIC SECTION.\n    INTERFACES if_edocument_base_ext.\nENDCLASS.\n\nMETHOD if_edocument_base_ext~determine_process.\n  rv_edoc_class   = 'ZCL_MY_COUNTRY_DOC'.\n  rv_process_type = 'Z_MYPROC'.\n  rv_version      = '0001'.\nENDMETHOD.\n```\n\nPlain-language takeaway  \nTo add your own DRC process in S/4HANA Cloud, you must implement three BAdIs—one to register the process (EDOCUMENT_BASE_EXT), one to build or tweak the XML (EDOC_ADAPTOR_CLOUD), and one to handle the outbound/inbound communication (EDOCUMENT_INT_CONN_EXT).",

         "Technical answer  \nYes. In SAP S/4HANA Cloud, public edition you can build your own ABAP class to perform process-mapping logic for SAP Document and Reporting Compliance (DRC). The supported way is:\n\n1. Use Developer Extensibility (ADT in a 3-system DEV/Q/P landscape).  \n2. Implement the released DRC enhancement BAdI that the framework exposes for “Electronic-Document Processing”.  \n   • In ADT: New → ABAP Cloud Project → BAdI Implementation → choose released enhancement (for example, BAdI EDO_PROCESSING_EXT).  \n   • Create your implementation class in customer namespace /Z* or /YY*.  \n3. Put the mapping code in the interface method that the BAdI defines (e.g. IF_EDO_PROCESSING_EXT~MAP_OUTBOUND).  \n   Example skeleton:  \n   ```\n   CLASS zcl_my_drc_mapper  DEFINITION\n       PUBLIC FINAL\n       CREATE PUBLIC.\n     PUBLIC SECTION.\n       INTERFACES if_edo_processing_ext.\n   ENDCLASS.\n\n   CLASS zcl_my_drc_mapper  IMPLEMENTATION.\n     METHOD if_edo_processing_ext~map_outbound.\n       \" 1. Read source billing / FI data from is_source_doc\n       \" 2. Fill et_target_edocument with the required XML structure\n       \" 3. Add your custom mapping/enrichment here\n     ENDMETHOD.\n   ENDCLASS.\n   ```\n4. Transport and activate the class; then register it in the Fiori app “Manage Electronic Documents” (App ID F4306) under your custom electronic-document process/version.  \n5. Provide any XSD/EDMX mapping artefacts and link the process to SAP Integration Suite for external submission.\n\nPrerequisites and limits  \n• You must have the DRC license and an SAP Integration Suite subscription.  \n• Only released objects (interfaces, data types, classes) are allowed; ADT will block the use of unreleased SAP APIs.  \n• Classic modification techniques (implicit/explicit enhancements, unreleased tables) are not available in public cloud.  \n• The same approach works for inbound response handling by implementing the corresponding BAdI method (e.g. MAP_INBOUND).\n\nPlain-language summary  \nYes—you can write your own ABAP class in S/4HANA Public Cloud to control DRC mapping; you do it by implementing the officially released DRC BAdI, activating it, and assigning it to your custom electronic-document process in the “Manage Electronic Documents” Fiori app.",

Calls the SD implementation from the super-class so that existing mapping logic is not lost.  \n2. If that logic did not determine a delivery date (rare for SM credit notes), it copies the posting date `KOMLFK-WFDAT`.  \n3. If no delivery address was found, it looks for the Ship-to partner in `WLF_KOMWBPA`, reads the linked ADRC address and fills the Peppol‐compatible address plus party name.  \n4. When a VAT number (`STCEG`) is available it is used as the delivery-location ID together with the standard scheme identifier.\n\nTo activate the source type for France B2B you only need to:  \n• create the above Z-class,  \n• assign it to source type “STLMT_INV” in Customizing (view `EDO_CUST_SRC` or Fiori app “Define Source Types”).  \nNo other framework change is required—the enhanced `FILL_DELIVERY` will be picked up automatically whenever a Settlement-Management document is processed in the France B2B eInvoicing scenario.\n\nPlain-language summary  \nThe new method simply calls the standard SD logic and, if that logic does not fill anything (because the document is a settlement one), it fetches the delivery date and the Ship-to address from the settlement-specific tables and puts them into the Peppol/UBL “Delivery” block so that France B2B invoices are generated without errors.",

Correct Identification: The answer correctly identifies CL_EDOC_MAP_FR_B2B_SD as the class that is already doing mapping for another source type (SD invoices) but not for settlement management documents.\n\n2. Class Hierarchy: It accurately describes the class hierarchy, starting with CL_EDOC_MAP_FR_B2B as the generic France B2B mapper and CL_EDOC_MAP_FR_B2B_SD as the concrete subclass for Sales-and-Distribution.\n\n3. Method Details: The answer provides details about the FILL_INVOICE method in CL_EDOC_MAP_FR_B2B_SD, which populates the UBL request from SD billing data.\n\n4. Source Type Coverage: It correctly states that Settlement-Management (source type based on MM/SD rebate or MM settlement) is not covered by the existing subclass.\n\n5. Reusability: The answer suggests that the existing SD-specific class can be reused or extended as a template for the new settlement management source type.\n\n6. Code Evidence: It includes a relevant code snippet from the FILL_INVOICE method, demonstrating the mapping process.\n\n7. Alignment with Expert Answer: The generated answer aligns perfectly with the expert answer, which simply stated \"CL_EDOC_MAP_FR_B2B_SD\".\n\n8. Additional Context: The answer provides valuable additional context about the France B2B e-Invoicing implementation and class structure, which goes beyond the expert answer but remains relevant and accurate.\n\nThe generated answer not only correctly identifies the class but also provides a comprehensive explanation of its role in the France B2B eInvoice mapping process, making it fully helpful in addressing the user's question.",

Since SAP S/4HANA 2023 FPS01 (private-cloud) the Document and Reporting Compliance (DRC) framework delivers an extensibility option that lets you restrict what users see in the eDocument Cockpit / “Manage Electronic Documents” app by means of your own custom field(s).\n\nBuilding blocks delivered by SAP  \n• Custom Field business context: “Document Compliance – eDocument Header”  \n• BAdI EDOC_CUSTOM_FIELDS – fill the new field whenever an eDocument is created (e.g. copy Sales Organisation or Company Code).  \n• BAdI EDOC_CUSTOM_FIELDS_UI – (optional) control how the field appears in the cockpit UI.  \n• IAM restriction type EDO_ORG (“Electronic Document: Restriction for Organizational Unit”).  \n• Authorisation tools: Fiori apps “Business Roles” and “Maintain Restrictions”.\n\nEnd-to-end steps (private cloud)  \n1. Create the extension field in app “Custom Fields & Logic”.  \n2. Implement BAdI EDOC_CUSTOM_FIELDS to populate the field during document generation.  \n3. In your business roles, maintain restriction type EDO_ORG and enter the allowed field values per role.  \n4. Users will now only see eDocuments whose ZZ_… field value matches the list assigned to their role.  \n5.

         "Technical explanation\n1. SAP has provided a dedicated enhancement spot ES_EDOCUMENT_CLOUD with BAdI EDOC_PART_CONN_CHANGE_EMAIL_V2.  \n2. Every time you press the Customer button in app “Manage Electronic Documents” (or “eDocument Cockpit”) for the Germany Customer-Invoice scenario, framework class CL_EDOCUMENT_EXT_ES→SEND_EMAIL_TO_CUST builds the e-mail and then calls this BAdI.  \n3. By implementing the BAdI you receive the e-mail object just before SAP Business Communication Service sends it, so you can adapt:  \n   • Sender / To / Cc / Bcc addresses  \n   • Subject line  \n   • Plain-text or HTML body  \n   • Existing PDF/XML attachment (rename, replace)  \n   • Add additional attachments (XSTRING; MIME type; language; ≤255 char name)  \n4. The BAdI is cloud-ready: you can create it either  \n   • In-App (Fiori app “Custom Logic”) – key-user extensibility, or  \n   • Developer Extensibility (ADT/Eclipse) – Steampunk embedded.  \n   The generated class exposes method CHANGE_EMAIL_TO_CUSTOMER (similar name in the editor) with changing parameters for all fields above plus virus-scan profile, etc.  \n5. No further framework coding is required for the standard process. If you build an own process step you simply call CL_EDOCUMENT_EXT_ES→SEND_EMAIL_TO_CUST and the same BAdI will fire.\n\nCode snippet (ADT or Custom Logic editor)\n```\nMETHOD change_email_to_customer.\n* Example: add greeting, attach T&Cs PDF\n  DATA lv_body_html TYPE string.\n\n  \"Add salutation to existing HTML\n  lv_body_html = '<p>Dear Customer,</p>' && is_email_params-body_html.\n  is_email_params-body_html = lv_body_html.\n\n  \"Change subject\n  is_email_params-subject = |Invoice { iv_document_id } from ACME GmbH|.\n\n  \"Add extra attachment\n  DATA ls_attach TYPE edoc_s_email_attachment.\n  ls_attach-file_name = |ACME_TandCs.pdf|.\n  ls_attach-mime_type = 'application/pdf'.\n  ls_attach-content   = get_tandcs_pdf( ).   \"returns XSTRING\n  APPEND ls_attach TO ct_attachments.\nENDMETHOD.\n```\n\nTesting\n1. Create/validate a German eDocument.  \n2. Manage Electronic Documents → status “Validation Passed” → press Customer.  \n3. Check recipient mailbox or Output Log; your changes appear.\n\nPlain-language answer\nUse SAP’s BAdI EDOC_PART_CONN_CHANGE_EMAIL_V2 (available in S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition) to rewrite the e-mail before it leaves the system; implement it via the Custom Logic app or ABAP Cloud, change any header/body/attachment you need, activate, and test the result from “Manage Electronic Documents”.",

         "The generated answer is fully helpful and accurately addresses the user's question about enhancing the generated XML for a Turkish customer invoice process in Public Cloud using ADT before sending it to the authorities. Here's why:\n\n1. Accuracy: The answer correctly states that it is possible to enhance the XML file before it is sent to the authorities, which aligns with the expert answer.\n\n2. Completeness: The generated answer provides more detailed information than the expert answer, including:\n   - Specific BAdIs available for customization (BADI_EDOC_TR_INVOICE_CHANGE, BADI_EDOC_TR_INV_LINE_CHG, BADI_EDOC_TR_EINV_ID_GEN)\n   - Methods within these BAdIs (CHANGE_HEADER_DATA, CHANGE_ITEM_DATA, CHANGE_EINV_ID)\n   - An explanation of how the process works\n   - Constraints in Public Cloud\n   - An example code snippet\n\n3. Context: The answer mentions that these customizations are part of scope item 5XU (Document & Reporting Compliance – Turkey) and are implemented in ABAP Development Tools (ADT) via the \"Custom Logic\" Fiori app, which provides valuable context for implementation.\n\n4. Alignment with tool output: The generated answer is consistent with the information provided by the sap_documentation_summary tool, which confirms the integration with SAP Document and Reporting Compliance, Cloud Edition and the ability to map fields to XML.\n\n5. Practical guidance: The answer includes an example code snippet, which is helpful for users who want to implement the enhancement.\n\n6. Clear summary: The answer concludes with a plain-language summary that reinforces the key point in simple terms.\n\nWhile the expert answer mentions the method SET_OUTPUT_DATA of the Business Add-In (BAdI) EDOC_ADAPTOR_CLOUD, the generated answer provides more specific and up-to-date information about the BAdIs available for Turkish customer invoices. This difference does not detract from the helpfulness of the generated answer, as it appears to be more tailored to the specific use case of Turkish customer invoices in Public Cloud.\n\nIn conclusion, the generated answer is fully helpful, providing accurate, detailed, and practical information that directly addresses the user's question and goes beyond the expert answer in terms of specificity and implementation guidance.",

         "Technical answer  \nYes. SAP S/4HANA Cloud, public edition for Turkey exposes three dedicated Business Add-Ins (BAdIs) that let you programmatically change the e-Invoice XML just before it is handed over for signature / transfer to the Turkish Revenue Administration (TRA).  \nThe BAdIs are delivered with scope item 5XU (Document & Reporting Compliance – Turkey) and are implemented in ABAP Development Tools (ADT) via the “Custom Logic” Fiori app:\n\n1. BADI_EDOC_TR_INVOICE_CHANGE  \n   “Turkey: Filling of Invoice Headers in Invoice XML Files”  \n   • Method CHANGE_HEADER_DATA – alter, add or overwrite any header-level XML tag.  \n\n2. BADI_EDOC_TR_INV_LINE_CHG  \n   “Turkey: Filling of Invoice Lines in Invoice XML Files”  \n   • Method CHANGE_ITEM_DATA – adjust line-item nodes.  \n\n3. BADI_EDOC_TR_EINV_ID_GEN  \n   “Turkey: Generation of Electronic Invoice IDs”  \n   • Method CHANGE_EINV_ID – replace the invoice UUID/ID if required.\n\nHow it works  \n• XML mapping is created by SAP standard.  \n• Immediately afterwards the runtime calls the above BAdIs; you receive the draft XML structures (IS_*), adjust the change structures (CS_*), and the framework serialises your result.  \n• The modified XML can be previewed in the “eDocument Cockpit” (Preview XML button) and is then forwarded to SAP Integration Suite / service provider for submission.\n\nConstraints in Public Cloud  \n• You cannot touch the XML after the signing step or inside the Integration Suite tenant; only the BAdIs above are allowed.  \n• All coding must comply with the UBL-TR schema; otherwise the file is rejected during validation.  \n• Transport is done with “Export Software Collection”.\n\nExample snippet (header BAdI)  \n\nMETHOD if_badi_edoc_tr_inv_change~change_header_data.\n  \" Add BillingReference only for return invoices\n  IF is_header_std-invoice_type_code = 'IADE'.\n    cl_edoc_utilities=>set_value(\n      EXPORTING\n        iv_path  = '/Invoice/cac:BillingReference/cbc:InvoiceDocumentReference/cbc:ID'\n        iv_value = is_header_std-bill_ref ).\n  ENDIF.\nENDMETHOD.\n\nPlain-language summary  \nYes—you can safely insert your own logic in ADT (via Custom Logic BAdIs) to tweak Turkey e-Invoice XML files before they are sent to the tax authority.",
