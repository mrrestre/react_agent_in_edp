Prerequisites  \n   • Tenant type: SAP S/4HANA Cloud, public edition with Developer Extensibility (ADT/Eclipse) enabled.  \n   • Your user must have the SAP_BR_DEVELOPER role.  \n   • Make sure the Greece eDocument objects are released for developer use; if not, open an SAP incident.\n\n2. Find the correct enhancement exit  \n   • In ADT open ABAP Repository → Enhancement Spots → ES_EDOCUMENT_CLOUD.  \n   • Locate BAdI EDOC_ADAPTOR_CLOUD (this runtime exit is called after the standard XML is built and just before it is stored and passed to AIF).\n\n3. Determine the filter values for Greece  \n   • In table EDOC_ADAPTORFILT (display via ADT) look up the line for Greece; delivered key is usually:  \n        Country = ‘GR’ Generic_Filter = ‘GR_MYDATA’ (or the exact key SAP delivered for your release).  \n   • You will use these two fields as the mandatory BAdI filter so your code runs only for Greek eDocuments.\n\n4. Create the BAdI implementation in ADT  \n   a. File → New → BAdI Implementation  \n   b. Enhancement Spot = ES_EDOCUMENT_CLOUD  \n   c. BAdI = EDOC_ADAPTOR_CLOUD  \n   d.

         "Technical answer  \nYes – within SAP S/4HANA Cloud, public edition you have a single, SAP-supported enhancement point that lets you touch the Greece myDATA XML before it is handed to the tax-authority web service:\n\n• BAdI “Cloud EDOC Adaptor BADI: Modify Final Invoice XML”  \n  – Business Context: eDocument: Greece  \n  – Implemented with Fiori app “Custom Logic” (no classic SE18 in public cloud).  \n  – You receive the complete XML in parameter CV_XML (XSTRING).  \n  – You can change, add, or delete nodes/values as long as the file still validates against the myDATA XSD delivered by SAP.  \n  – You may also run custom checks and raise an error (append to CT_RETURN) so the eDocument stops with status “Error” in the cockpit.\n\nSupported but non-coding adaptations  \n• Configure Value Mapping app (namespace /EDOGR) – substitute internal ↔ external codes (UoM, VAT exemption reason, payment type, etc.) that the standard mapping already exposes.  \n• The rest of the mapping (SAP-delivered XSLT and AIF interface classes) is a “black box”; you cannot replace or modify them.\n\nNot possible / unsupported  \n• Copying or changing SAP XSLT objects in package EDOC_GR*  \n• Adding new XML elements that are not part of the official AADE schema  \n• Replacing the SAP interface connector class\n\nQuick how-to example (Custom Logic):  \n1.

Activate, resubmit the eDocument in “Manage Electronic Documents” and check the XML in the cockpit log.\n\nPlain-language summary  \nYou can tweak the Greece invoice XML in public cloud, but only through the dedicated “Modify Final Invoice XML” BAdI (or simple value-mapping tables); everything else in the XML creation flow is SAP-locked.",

In SAP S/4HANA Cloud, public edition (Turkey localization), you are allowed to add or change an “action” only for a process that you yourself created with the Electronic Document Processing framework.  \n• You build the custom process with developer-extensibility (ABAP Cloud) or the Custom Logic app.  \n• Inside that process you expose the required BAdI (for example EDOCUMENT_ACTION_EXTEND) and implement your own ABAP class to supply the new action logic (mapping, call to service provider, status update, etc.).  \n• Because the process is customer-owned, the action enhancement is permitted and survives upgrades.  \n• You cannot change or replace the predefined actions that SAP delivers for the standard Turkey e-document scenario; those are locked in public cloud.\n\nMini-example  \n1. Create custom process Z_TRK_EINV under “Manage Electronic Document Processing.”  \n2. In ADT open BAdI EDOCUMENT_ACTION_EXTEND (released for Cloud).  \n3.

Here's why:\n\n1. Accuracy: The generated answer correctly states that Actions cannot be extended in Public Cloud, which aligns with the expert answer.\n\n2. Comprehensive explanation: The answer provides a detailed technical explanation of why this isn't possible, mentioning that the list of Actions is hard-coded in SAP tables (EDOC_CACT or EDOC_ACTIONS) and not exposed for customization.\n\n3. Extensibility limitations: It clearly outlines the limits of SAP's released extensibility for Document Compliance, which includes adding custom fields and injecting logic during certain processes, but not creating or modifying cockpit actions.\n\n4. Alternative solutions: The answer goes beyond just saying \"no\" and provides helpful alternatives for custom processing, such as creating a separate RAP/Fiori app or using standard job templates.\n\n5. Alignment with tool output: While the tool output suggests some extensibility options, it doesn't contradict the answer. The generated answer correctly interprets that these extensions don't allow for adding new Actions in the eDocument Cockpit.\n\n6.

         "Technical explanation  \n• In SAP S/4HANA Cloud, public edition, the list of “Actions” that appear in the eDocument Cockpit / Manage Electronic Documents apps is hard-coded in SAP table EDOC_CACT (or EDOC_ACTIONS).  \n• Those tables are on the SAP-controlled configuration layer and are not exposed by any SSCUI, CBC activity, or released BAdI.  \n• SAP’s released extensibility for Document Compliance is limited to:  \n  – adding custom fields (BAdI EDOC_CUSTOM_FIELDS_CLOUD and its UI pair)  \n  – injecting logic during validation, XML creation, or authorisation checks.  \n• No released extension point lets a customer create or modify cockpit actions; therefore a brand-new “Action” (menu entry/button) cannot be added for a custom process in the Public Cloud tenant.  \n• If you need custom processing you must trigger it outside the cockpit (e.g. a separate RAP/Fiori app that calls the public eDocument APIs) or schedule one of SAP’s standard background job templates.\n\nPlain-language answer  \nNo. In the SAP S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition you cannot add or extend an Action inside the eDocument Cockpit; only SAP’s predefined actions are available.\n\nExample alternatives  \n• Create a custom RAP app that reads eDocument status via EDOC_API_SRV and performs your additional processing.  \n• Use the standard job template “eDocument (General): Process Actions in the Background” to automate the SAP-delivered actions, then follow up with your own job.",

         "Technical answer  \n• In SAP S/4HANA Cloud, private edition (P-edition) only the “released for customer” BAdIs that appear in the Fiori app Custom Logic are allowed.  \n  – Tool result (sap_help_lookup) lists every cockpit-related BAdI that is exposed in Cloud; BADI_EDOC_PROCESS_CONTROLLER – the classic exit that lets you register or change cockpit actions – is NOT on that list.  \n• The framework class that draws the action buttons (CL_EDOC_PROCESS_CONTROLLER) is called through the unreleased BAdI BADI_EDOC_PROCESS_CONTROLLER (enhancement spot EDOC_PROCESSING).  \n  – This BAdI is still present in the ABAP stack for compatibility with on-premise systems, but its “Released for customer” flag is unchecked, therefore it is blocked in Cloud extensibility; you cannot create an implementation in Custom Logic and the modification layer is locked in P-edition.  \n• All configuration tables that bind an action to a process (EDOPROCDEF, EDOPROCFUNC, EDOPROCFUNCASGV …) are in the SAP namespace. In private-cloud tenants they are protected against customer maintenance (modifiable only by SAP Support).  \n• Result: you may enrich or validate the data that an existing action executes (for example with Cloud EDOC_ADAPTOR_BADI, EDOC_GR_* BAdIs, etc.), but you cannot add a new cockpit action or change the sequence/visibility of the delivered ones for a self-developed eDocument process.  \n• Only in pure on-premise deployments (or P-edition systems that SAP explicitly opens via a modification key) can you:  \n  1. Implement BADI_EDOC_PROCESS_CONTROLLER in SE18/SE19,  \n  2. Create a custom Z-class that executes your logic,  \n  3. Create a new process-step/action entry in the above EDOC* tables.  \n  This path is outside the supported scope of S/4HANA Cloud, private edition.\n\nExample for what IS possible in P-edition  \n• Add a new XML tag before SUBMIT is executed:  \n  – Fiori ► Custom Logic ► Business Context “Document and Reporting Compliance” ► BAdI “Cloud EDOC Adaptor: Modify Final Invoice XML”.  \n  – Code: `et_edoc_xml = z_my_enhance_xml( it_edoc_xml ).`\n\nExample for what is NOT allowed  \n• Trying to create a new cockpit button “ARCHIVE”:  \n  – Customizing view V_EDOPROCFUNC → “New Entries” → error message “Object belongs to SAP namespace”.  \n  – SE18 ► BADI_EDOC_PROCESS_CONTROLLER → “Create” → greyed-out because unreleased.\n\nConclusion  \nNo – in S/4HANA Cloud, private edition you cannot extend or add a cockpit action; you are limited to the actions delivered by SAP. Only data-level exits supplied in the Custom Logic app are supported. On-premise systems remain the only deployment where BADI_EDOC_PROCESS_CONTROLLER can legally be implemented to introduce custom actions.\n\nPlain-language summary  \nYou can change what an existing button does, but you cannot add your own new button to the eDocument Cockpit in the private-cloud version of SAP.",

In SAP S/4HANA Cloud (public edition) both Fiori apps—Manage Electronic Documents (F4306) and the classic eDocument Cockpit—can be enhanced with your own fields by using the standard “key-user” and “developer” extensibility framework delivered with release 2402 and higher.\n\nKey-user steps  \n1. Create the field  \n   • App: Custom Fields → Create  \n   • Business Context: Electronic Document Header or Electronic Document Item  \n   • Enable Usage for  \n     – UIs → Manage Electronic Documents  \n     – (optionally) CDS views / APIs if the value must reach the XML message  \n   • Publish the field.  \n2. Place the field on the UI  \n   • Open Manage Electronic Documents → Adapt UI  \n   • Drag the field into the table list or the “Document Details” area and save the variant.  \n3. (Optional) Derive the value automatically  \n   • App: Custom Logic  \n   • Enhancement spot EDOC_HEADER_FLD_MAPPING (or other process-specific spots)  \n   • Implement ABAP code that copies data from the source document (e.g. VBRK) into your new field.  \n4. (Optional) Transfer the field to the outbound XML  \n   • Generic e-Invoicing/Peppol: Configuration activity “Map Fields to XML File” → link the UBL/Peppol element to the custom field.  \n   • Brazil NF-e/NFS-e: Implement BAdI NFE_CLOUD_EXTENSIBILITY → method ADD_FIELDS to append the data to the NF-e structure.  \n5. (Optional) Restrict visibility by organisation  \n   • Use restriction type EDO_ORG in Maintain Business Roles to limit access based on the content of your (possibly custom) org-unit field.\n\nDeveloper extensibility (for 3-system tenants)  \n• Same custom field creation, but you can implement ABAP classes for BAdIs (e.g. IF_NFE_CLOUD_EXTENSIBILITY) in ADT/Eclipse for advanced mapping or validation logic.\n\nApplicability  \n• Available in public-cloud tenants as of SAP S/4HANA Cloud 2402 (no switch needed).  \n• Works for all processes handled by Document and Reporting Compliance: Peppol, EU VAT, Brazil NF-e/NFS-e, etc.  \n• No modification of SAP objects; everything is upgrade-safe.\n\nShort example  \n1. Add field “Reason for Zero VAT” (type CHAR40) in context Electronic Document Header.  \n2. Place it in the Document Details section.  \n3. In Custom Logic:  \n   ```\n   lv_reason = select single begru        \n               from vbrk where vbeln = is_source-vbeln. \n   es_extension-reason_zero_vat = lv_reason.\n   ```  \n4. In “Map Fields to XML File” map the UBL element `<cac:TaxCategory><cbc:TaxExemptionReason>` to field `EXT_REASON_ZERO_VAT`.\n\nPlain-language takeaway  \nYou can safely add your own columns or data fields to the Manage Electronic Documents (or eDocument Cockpit) app in SAP S/4HANA Cloud, show them on the screen, fill them with custom logic, and even include them in the legally required XML—no custom coding outside the standard extensibility framework is needed.",

In SAP S/4HANA Cloud, public edition for Spain you can add your own field to any delivered eDocument process (for example “Spain eInvoice – Webservice”) and show it in the eDocument Cockpit (Fiori app F3362).  \nSAP delivers two cloud-BAdIs that enable the extension:\n\n1. EDOC_CUSTOM_FIELDS_CLOUD – fills the new field when the eDocument is created.  \n2. EDOC_CUSTOM_FIELDS_UI_CLOUD – controls how the field is displayed in the cockpit list.\n\nThe procedure is fully key-user driven and therefore supported in the public cloud:\n\nStep 1  Create the field  \n• App “Custom Fields” (F1481) → Business Context “Document Compliance” → define the field (e.g. ZZ_ORG_UNIT_ES) and Publish.\n\nStep 2  Populate the field  \n• App “Custom Logic” (F1482) → Business Context “Document Compliance” → BAdI “eDocument Custom Fields (EDOC_CUSTOM_FIELDS_CLOUD)”.  \n• Set filter PROCESS = the Spanish process ID, e.g. ES_FACTURAE.  \n• ABAP snippet fills cs_custom_fields-zz_org_unit_es from the source document.\n\nStep 3  Show the field in the cockpit (optional, if default layout not sufficient)  \n• Create a second implementation for BAdI “eDocument Custom Fields (UI) (EDOC_CUSTOM_FIELDS_UI_CLOUD)” with the same filter.  \n• Specify visibility, column order, label, etc.\n\nStep 4  Test  \n• Generate a new Spanish eDocument → open eDocument Cockpit → column appears and is filled.  \n(Only eDocuments created after the BAdI implementation carry the new value.)\n\nNo on-premise IMG activity is needed; everything runs through the Fiori key-user tools and the two BAdIs are released for use in the public cloud (component CA-EDO-SP).\n\nPlain-language summary  \nYes—you can add your own column to Spanish eDocuments in the cockpit by creating a custom field in the “Custom Fields” app and filling/displaying it with the two released BAdIs EDOC_CUSTOM_FIELDS_CLOUD and EDOC_CUSTOM_FIELDS_UI_CLOUD.",

         "Technical explanation  \nYes – SAP Document and Reporting Compliance is delivered with a field-level authorisation framework that lets you hide individual eDocuments in both apps (“Manage Electronic Documents” and “eDocument Cockpit”) by means of custom extension fields.  \nThe workflow is:\n\n1. Create the restriction field  \n   • Fiori app “Custom Fields” (F1481) – Business Context = Document Compliance → e.g. field Z_ORG_UNIT (type Code/Text).  \n   • Publish the field. It is automatically added to the CDS views and OData service used by the cockpit apps.\n\n2. Populate the field when the eDocument is generated  \n   • Fiori app “Custom Logic” (F1482)  \n   • Implement BAdI EDOC_CUSTOM_FIELDS_CLOUD to fill the persistence field, e.g.  \n     `Z_ORG_UNIT = billing_document-sales_org.`  \n   • (Optional) implement BAdI EDOC_CUSTOM_FIELDS_UI_CLOUD to expose the value in the UI column.\n\n3. Activate the authorisation object  \n   • No extra coding: once the field is published, it becomes eligible in the delivered authorisation object “Electronic Document: Restriction for Organisational Unit”.\n\n4. Maintain role-based restrictions  \n   • Fiori app “Business Catalogs” → locate SAP_SD_BC_GLO_EDOC_PC and note the business roles that use it.  \n   • Fiori app “Maintain Business Roles” (F1368) → Maintain Restrictions → object “Electronic Document: Restriction for Organisational Unit”.  \n   • For each role select the eDocument process (billing, accounting, etc.), pick the custom field (Z_ORG_UNIT), and enter the allowed values (e.g. 1000, 2000).\n\n5. Result at runtime  \n   • The CDS access control (DCL) filters the data set, so the cockpit/value helps only return documents whose custom-field value matches the user’s authorised list.  \n   • Same logic applies to both SAP Fiori apps: “Manage Electronic Documents” (tile F5190) and “eDocument Cockpit” (tile F4111).\n\nShort example  \nRole “Billing Clerk – North”  \n  Process = SD_BILLING  \n  Field   = Z_ORG_UNIT  \n  Allowed values = 1000  \n\nThe user assigned to this role will only see eDocuments whose Z_ORG_UNIT = 1000; all others are completely hidden.\n\nPlain-language summary  \nCreate a custom field that stores an organisational key on every eDocument, fill it via BAdI, then use the delivered role restrictions to allow or block individual field values – this hides the corresponding eDocuments from users’ cockpit lists.",

         "Technical explanation  \nYes. SAP S/4HANA provides an authorization-restriction type that filters the list of electronic documents (eDocuments) shown in the apps “Manage Electronic Documents” (Fiori ID F4306) and “eDocument Cockpit” (Fiori ID F2380):\n\n1. Authorization object / restriction type  \n   • Electronic Document: Restriction for Organizational Unit (technical name EDO_ORG; delivered with S/4HANA Cloud 2302).\n\n2. Steps to activate it  \n   a. Create a custom field that stores the organizational-unit value you want to authorize on (sales org, company code, profit center, …)  \n      – App “Custom Fields and Custom Logic” → Business context “Electronic Document”.  \n      – Enable the field for both apps’ UIs and publish it.  \n\n   b. Fill the field automatically during eDocument creation  \n      – Implement a BAdI / “Custom Logic” determination to copy the org-unit from the source document (e.g. VBRK-VKORG for billing).  \n\n   c. Expose the field on the app UI (Adapt UI or key-user adaptation).  \n\n   d. Define the authorization restriction  \n      – App “Maintain Business Roles”.  \n      – For every role that contains the catalog of the eDocument apps, open “Restrictions”.  \n      – Select object “Electronic Document: Restriction for Organizational Unit (EDO_ORG)”.  \n      – In the “Read, Value Help” tab enter the allowed organizational-unit values.  \n      – Save and publish the role.\n\n3. Result  \n   When users open the Manage Electronic Documents or eDocument Cockpit app, the framework appends a WHERE-clause based on the EDO_ORG restriction. Users see only those eDocuments whose custom field holds an organizational-unit value they are authorized for.\n\nShort example  \n• Custom field YY1_ORGUNIT_ED contains the sales organization.  \n• Role “DE_SALES_CLERK” → Restriction EDO_ORG = “DE10”.  \n• A user with that role sees only eDocuments whose YY1_ORGUNIT_ED = “DE10”.\n\nPlain-language summary  \nYes—you can hide eDocuments from users by adding an org-unit field to each eDocument and then using the delivered IAM restriction “Electronic Document: Restriction for Organizational Unit” in Business Role Maintenance to let each user role see only the documents that belong to its permitted organizational units.",

         "Technical explanation  \n1. Locate the cloud-replacement BAdI that controls whether an electronic document is generated:  \n   Enhancement spot ES_EDOCUMENT_CLOUD → BAdI EDOC_ADAPTOR_CLOUD (successor of on-premise EDOCUMENT_CREATE_CHECK).  \n2. In ABAP Development Tools (ADT) create a new enhancement implementation:  \n   • File → New → Enhancement Implementation  \n   • Choose spot ES_EDOCUMENT_CLOUD and select BAdI EDOC_ADAPTOR_CLOUD  \n   • Provide implementation name, short text, and a global class (e.g. ZCL_EDOC_SKIP_ES).  \n3. Add the logic that decides when to skip creation. Typical coding pattern in the supplied method (e.g. ADAPTOR_INITIAL_CHECK):  \n\n```\nMETHOD if_edoc_adaptor_cloud~initial_check.\n  IF iv_country = 'ES' AND iv_company_code = 'ES01'\n     AND xsdbool( is_source_doc-billing_category = 'O' ).  \"example rule\n    ev_skip_edoc = abap_true.          \"tells framework not to create eDocument\n    ev_message  = VALUE #( msgid = 'EDOCUMENT'\n                           msgno = '098'\n                           msgty = 'I'\n                           msgv1 = 'eDoc skipped by customer rule' ).\n  ENDIF.\nENDMETHOD.\n```  \n\n   Return ev_skip_edoc = abap_true (or raise the supplied exception) for every source document that must not produce an eDocument.  \n4. Activate the BAdI implementation; no further SSCUI or SPRO activity is necessary.  \n5. Test in the “Manage Electronic Documents” (F5337) or “eDocument Cockpit” (F2542) apps: create a billing document that meets and one that does not meet the rule. Only the latter should appear with an eDocument.  \n6. (Optionally) implement BAdI EDOC_CUSTOM_FIELDS_UI_CLOUD to surface your custom rejection message or fields in the cockpit UI.  \n\nKey points  \n• Public Cloud restricts authorizations at app level, but the “Create” function cannot be hidden; suppression must occur in backend logic.  \n• EDOC_ADAPTOR_CLOUD is explicitly documented as the place to “define that for some types of source documents the system doesn’t create electronic documents.”  \n• Activation is transport-free (local object) and effective immediately for Spain or any other country codes you specify.  \n\nPlain-language summary  \nIn SAP S/4HANA Public Cloud (Spain) you stop unwanted eDocuments by writing a short enhancement (BAdI EDOC_ADAPTOR_CLOUD) that tells the system “skip eDocument” whenever your own conditions are met; you create and activate this enhancement in ADT, and from then on the Manage Electronic Documents/eDocument Cockpit apps will no longer generate entries for the blocked cases.",

Maintain the mandatory filter combination (for example COUNTRY = ‘IN’ and, if required, GENERIC_FILTER = ‘IN_GSTR’; use your own country / generic values for other scenarios).  \n3. Implement interface IF_EDOC_ADAPTOR_CLOUD in the generated class and code logic in method ADAPT_DOCUMENT.  \n4. Inside ADAPT_DOCUMENT decide whether the eDocument must be skipped.  \n  • Set cs_edocument-skip_generation = abap_true   or  \n  • Append an error message of type ‘A’ or ‘E’ to ct_messages.  \n The framework interprets either action as “do not persist the eDocument”, so nothing is written to table EDOCUMENT and the item never appears in EDOC_COCKPIT.\n\nSample implementation (Public Cloud, ABAP Cloud project in ADT)\n\n```\nCLASS zcl_edoc_skip_invoicing            \n  DEFINITION\n  PUBLIC\n  FINAL\n  CREATE PUBLIC .\n\n  PUBLIC SECTION.\n    INTERFACES if_edoc_adaptor_cloud.     \"supplied automatically\nENDCLASS.\n\nCLASS zcl_edoc_skip_invoicing\n  IMPLEMENTATION.\n\n  METHOD if_edoc_adaptor_cloud~adapt_document.\n\n    \"Example rule: skip zero-value SD invoices\n    IF cs_source_data-billing_header-net_value IS INITIAL.\n      cs_edocument-skip_generation = abap_true.\n\n      \"optional success info – will be stored in application log\n      APPEND VALUE #( type   = 'S'\n                      id     = 'EDOC'\n                      number = '001'\n                      message_v1 = |eDocument skipped – net value = 0| )\n             TO ct_messages.\n\n      RETURN.   \"nothing else to do\n    ENDIF.\n\n    \"further mapping/changes possible here …\n\n  ENDMETHOD.\nENDCLASS.\n```\n\nHow it works at runtime  \n• When a billing (or FI) document is posted, the EDOC framework calls ADAPT_DOCUMENT.  \n• If your code sets skip_generation or raises an error, the framework exits before persisting the eDocument.  \n• Users will not see such documents in EDOC_COCKPIT; they can check the application log for your informational message.\n\nTesting / transport  \n– Post a billing document whose net value = 0; verify no entry is created in EDOCUMENT / EDOC_COCKPIT.  \n– Post a normal invoice; the BAdI lets it pass, so the eDocument is created.  \n– The implementation is transported like any other Cloud ABAP enhancement; no separate SPRO step is required.\n\nPlain-language summary  \nAdd a small BAdI implementation (EDOC_ADAPTOR_CLOUD) and, in its ADAPT_DOCUMENT method, set the “skip_generation” flag (or raise an error) whenever your business rule is met—this cleanly blocks eDocuments from being created in SAP S/4HANA Public Cloud.",

         "Technical explanation (expert view)\n\n1. Prerequisites  \n   • Scope item 5XU “Document and Reporting Compliance – Greece” is activated.  \n   • You create/monitor e-documents in the apps “Manage Electronic Documents” or “eDocument Cockpit”.  \n   • You have the Key User role that allows Custom Logic and Value Mapping maintenance.\n\n2. Implement the Greece XML-adjustment BAdI  \n   a. Launchpad → app “Custom Logic” → Create.  \n   b. Business Context: Electronic Document (Greece) (component CA-GTF-CSC-EDO-GR).  \n   c. BAdI Name: EDOC_SINGLE_ADJUST_XML – “Adjust Single XML Before Submission”.  \n   d. Accept the default ABAP for Cloud draft implementation and press Create.  \n\n3. Code your enhancement  \n   The method provides a changing parameter io_xml_document (XCO XML object) that already contains SAP’s standard XML. Typical actions:  \n   • Fill empty tags that the mapping left blank.  \n   • Change calculated values (e.g. rounding, alternative VAT base).  \n   • Add country-specific optional tags required by your myDATA service provider.  \n   • Perform consistency checks and, if an error is found, raise a failed message to stop processing (message appears in the cockpit log).  \n\n   Mini-example: add an extra node with an alternative supplier registration number  \n   ```abap\n   DATA(lo_root) = io_xml_document->get_root_element( ).\n   DATA(lo_header) = lo_root->get_first_child_by_name( 'InvoiceHeader' ).\n   IF lo_header IS BOUND.\n     lo_header->add_child( )->set_name( 'AltSupplierID' )->set_value( iv_alt_id ).\n   ENDIF.\n   ```\n\n4. Publish and transport  \n   • Press “Publish” in Custom Logic; the runtime artefact is generated.  \n   • Use Cloud Transport Management (or retrofit) if you need the logic in other tenants.\n\n5. Test the enhancement  \n   a. In “Manage Electronic Documents” (or the cockpit) locate a document → “Reset to Draft”.  \n   b. “Submit” again.  \n   c. Open the XML preview; the new/changed tags should be present.  \n   d. If you deliberately raised an error, the processing status turns to “Error” and the log shows your message.\n\n6. Optional value-mapping for reverse-charge VAT (new in release 2402)  \n   App “Value Mapping” → table REV_VAT_TRANS_KEY → list the tax transaction keys that must be excluded from VAT amounts; standard XML logic will obey this mapping. No coding is needed, but it is part of “enhancing” the output.\n\nPlain-language summary  \nOpen the Fiori app “Custom Logic”, create an implementation of BAdI EDOC_SINGLE_ADJUST_XML, write the ABAP-for-Cloud code that changes the XML, publish it, and then re-generate the XML from the eDocument Cockpit/Manage Electronic Documents app to see your adjustments.",

         "Technical explanation (SAP S/4HANA Cloud, public edition)\n\n1. Where the e-mail is produced  \n   • App “Manage Electronic Documents” (Fiori F4306) sends the customer invoice PDF/A-3 (Germany e-Invoice process).  \n   • Just before the message leaves the system, enhancement spot ES_EDOCUMENT_CLOUD calls BAdI EDOC_PART_CONN_CHANGE_EMAIL_V2.  \n   • If you do nothing, the standard template (basic text + PDF) is used.\n\n2. Object you enhance  \n   BAdI name   : EDOC_PART_CONN_CHANGE_EMAIL_V2 (released, successor of EDOC_PART_CONN_CHANGE_EMAIL)  \n   Interface   : IF_EDOC_PART_CONN_CHANGE_EMAIL_V2 → method CHANGE_EMAIL  \n\n   Key changing parameters you can overwrite  \n   – CT_EMAIL_RECEIVER (To/Cc/Bcc, address, name, language)  \n   – CS_EMAIL_SUBJECT  (single subject string)  \n   – CS_EMAIL_BODY   (HTML or plain text)  \n   – CT_ATTACHMENT_DATA (table; add-, remove- or rename PDF/XML/ZIP, etc.)\n\n3. How to implement – key-user (no ADT needed)  \n   a. Launch Fiori app “Custom Logic” → Create.  \n   b. Extension Point = EDOC_PART_CONN_CHANGE_EMAIL_V2.  \n   c. Optional filter: Country/Region = DE; Process = ‘CUSTOMER_INVOICE_EMAIL’.  \n   d.

         "Technical answer  \nYes. In SAP S/4HANA Public Cloud for Spain you can enrich or adapt the delivered “Customer Invoice – Spain (Facturae)” eDocument process. Two extensibility options are officially supported:\n\n1. Key-user (in-app) BAdIs  \n   • Use the Custom Logic app to implement BAdIs delivered for Document & Reporting Compliance (DRC).  \n   • Typical BAdIs:  \n     – EDOC_ADAPTOR_CLOUD → method IS_RELEVANT to decide when an invoice should create an eDocument.  \n     – Field-mapping BAdIs to populate extra XML elements (e.g. add a “Tax Exemption Reason” in the <Notes> section).  \n   • No licence change is required; changes are transportable in the standard 2-system landscape.\n\n2. Developer Extensibility (ABAP Cloud in the 3-system landscape)  \n   • For early adopters who have an SAP Document & Reporting Compliance licence and an SAP Integration Suite subscription.  \n   • You build your own enhancement class or even a brand-new electronic document process by re-using the DRC framework (orchestration, mapping, submission, acknowledgment).  \n   • All work is done in ADT/Eclipse; only released APIs and objects can be used.\n\nWhat you cannot do  \n• Change SAP-delivered XSDs or alter the legal XML structure.  \n• Apply classic user exits or modify standard code.  \n• Upload Z-objects into the core tenant outside the released ABAP Cloud package interfaces.\n\nExample snippet (Key-user)  \nBAdI Implementation: EDOC_MAP_CUST_INVOICE  \n```\nMETHOD fill_header_extension.\n  IF is_header-tax_exempt = abap_true.\n    cs_xml-note = |Tax exempt under art. 84 VAT law – reason: { is_header-exempt_reason }|.\n  ENDIF.\nENDMETHOD.\n```\nResult: the exemption reason appears in the outgoing Facturae XML without touching SAP standard.\n\nPlain-language takeaway  \nYes—SAP Public Cloud lets you add your own rules or extra fields to the Spanish e-invoice flow, using either key-user BAdIs or (for larger needs) the newer Developer Extensibility toolset, while still staying in compliance with Spain’s legal Facturae format.",

Document and Reporting Compliance (e-Document e-mails)  \n   • BAdI EDOC_PARTCONN_CHANGE_EMAIL_V2 exposes table parameter ATTACHMENTS (fields ATTACHM_TYPE, CONTENT_HEX, etc.).  \n   • In an in-app extension you can append any file (PDF, XML, TXT …) to the customer e-mail sent by the DRC “Partner Connector.”  \n   • Each content line must be ≤ 255 characters; overall mail-size restrictions still apply.\n\n3.

The answer aligns well with the expert answer in terms of the overall framework and components involved.\n\nHowever, there are a few reasons why the generated answer is classified as \"Partially Helpful\" rather than \"Fully Helpful\":\n\n1. Complexity: The generated answer is quite technical and may be overwhelming for users who are not familiar with SAP development. It could benefit from a more structured, step-by-step approach.\n\n2. Public Cloud specificity: While the answer does mention Public Cloud, it doesn't consistently emphasize the differences between Public Cloud and on-premises development throughout the explanation.\n\n3. Alignment with expert answer: The generated answer covers more topics than the expert answer, which is good, but it doesn't explicitly mention some key components highlighted in the expert answer, such as the Web Services Runtime and SAP Integration Suite.\n\n4. Tool-provided context: The answer incorporates some information from the tool outputs, but it doesn't fully utilize all the relevant information provided, especially regarding the landscape and tooling specific to Public Cloud development.\n\n5. Examples: While the answer includes some code snippets, it could benefit from more practical examples or use cases to illustrate the development process.\n\nOverall, the generated answer provides valuable information and covers many aspects of developing new processes for electronic documents in the EDP framework.

         "Technical explanation (how-to)\n\n1. Prerequisites  \n   • Have a 3-system SAP S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition tenant that is enabled for Developer Extensibility (ADT in Eclipse).  \n   • Assign role SAP_BR_DEVELOPER_0070 (catalog SAP_A4C_BC_DEV_GLO_EDO_PC).  \n   • Ensure your system is already integrated with SAP Document & Reporting Compliance, Cloud Edition (communication arrangement or SAP BTP Integration Suite iFlow).\n\n2. Design the new electronic-document process  \n   • Decide the process key you want to introduce, e.g. “ZPROC_FIINV_EXT”.  \n   • Identify the source document type(s) that shall trigger it (ACC_DOC, BIL_DOC, or a custom source type).  \n   • Decide whether the process is purely outbound, inbound, or bidirectional.\n\n3. Create ABAP objects in ADT (Developer Extensibility)  \n   a) Country/region handler class (mandatory)  \n      – ZCL_EDOC_XX_HANDLER implements IF_EDOCUMENT_EXT_ES.  \n      – Fill core methods: CREATE_EDOCUMENT, MAP_XML_DATA, PROCESS_SUBMIT / PROCESS_STATUS_REQUEST, etc.  \n   b) Optional mapping class if complex XML mapping required (e.g. ZCL_EDOC_XX_MAP).  \n   c) BAdI implementations (enhancement spot ES_EDOCUMENT_CLOUD):  \n      • EDOCUMENT_BASE_EXT                – returns PROCESS = ‘ZPROC_FIINV_EXT’ and HANDLER_CLASS = ‘ZCL_EDOC_XX_HANDLER’.  \n      • EDOCUMENT_INT_CONN_EXT            – controls the outbound call (SEND_REQUEST) to Integration Suite.  \n      • EDOC_ADAPTOR_CLOUD, EDOC_CUSTOM_FIELDS_CLOUD, EDOC_CUSTOM_FIELDS_UI_CLOUD, EDOCUMENT_MESSAGE_EXT as required.  \n   d) If you need a brand-new source type:  \n      • ZCL_EDOC_EXT_<SRC> implements IF_EDOC_SOURCE_EXTENSION (decides if document is relevant).  \n      • ZCL_EDOC_EXT_<SRC>_<PROC> implements IF_EDOC_SOURCE_PROCESS_EXT (extra mapping / filter).\n\n4. Register and configure the artefacts in Fiori (no SPRO in public cloud)  \n   • Manage eDocument Type – upload or maintain the XML schema / format definition.  \n   • Manage eDocument Process – create ‘ZPROC_FIINV_EXT’, assign source type(s), handler class, interface key.  \n   • Manage eDocument Interface – maintain service proxies / communication arrangement that points to the Integration Suite endpoint.  \n   • (Optional) Manage eDocument Message Type and status mapping table EDOMETASTATUS1V for inbound replies.  \n   • For custom source type registration use “Register Handling Classes for Source Extension”.\n\n5. Test and iterate  \n   • Post a test source document (e.g. FI invoice). The EDOCUMENT_BASE_EXT logic should create an eDocument record.  \n   • Use Fiori “Manage Electronic Documents” (or GUI EDOC_COCKPIT) to verify header & payload; execute “Submit”.  \n   • Check the outbound call in SAP Document & Reporting Compliance monitor and in the Integration Suite trace.  \n   • If the authority sends a response, EDOCUMENT_MESSAGE_EXT updates status; verify that the cockpit reflects it.\n\n6. Runtime considerations  \n   • Implement RESTRICT_CANCELLATION or DELETE_FROM_DB in the handler if you want special control for cancel/delete.  \n   • To expose extra fields in the cockpit, populate CUSTOM_FIELDS structure and implement the corresponding UI BAdI.  \n   • Review IAM role catalog changes after each quarterly upgrade (note 2975653).\n\n7. Go-live checklist  \n   • Transport (gCTS) the ABAP objects and the Fiori configuration across Q- and P-systems.  \n   • Activate communication arrangement in P-system.  \n   • Provide end-user roles (e.g. SAP_BR_EDOCUMENT_SPECIALIST_PC).  \n   • Monitor with “Manage Electronic Documents” and Integration Suite’s Message Monitor.\n\nPlain-language summary  \nCreate a new electronic document process in Public Cloud by writing a released ABAP handler class, plugging it into the framework via the provided BAdIs, registering the process, type, and interface in the Fiori “Manage eDocument …” apps, and then testing it end-to-end through the cockpit and Integration Suite.\n\nMini-snippet (BAdI EDOCUMENT_BASE_EXT)\n\nMETHOD if_badi_interface~execute.\n  PROCESS = 'ZPROC_FIINV_EXT'.\n  HANDLER_CLASS = 'ZCL_EDOC_FIINV_HANDLER'.\nENDMETHOD.\n\nMini-snippet (call to generic sender inside handler)\n\ncl_edocument_ext_es=>process_req_send_global(\n  EXPORTING\n    it_edocument   = lt_edoc_hdr\n    iv_interface   = 'WS_ZFIINV_01'\n    iv_process     = 'ZPROC_FIINV_EXT'\n    iv_submit_mode = cl_edocument_ext_es=>gc_submit_direct ).\n\nThese condensed steps follow SAP’s officially released guidance (see SAP Help “Electronic Document Processing Framework – Developer Extensibility” and the tool outputs above), ensuring an upgrade-safe custom process in the S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition environment.",

         "Technical explanation (based strictly on the two SAP documentation extracts above)\n\n1. The SAP-supported way to add another file to an e-mail is to call ADD_ATTACHMENT on the e-mail object.  \n   • With the new cloud-ready API CL_BCS_MAIL_MESSAGE you pass a ready-made “body-part” object (sap_help_lookup).  \n   • For binary data such as PDFs you create that body-part with CL_BCS_MAIL_BINARYPART=>CREATE_INSTANCE, supplying\n     – iv_content / iv_content_bin  (the PDF as XSTRING)  \n     – iv_content_type = 'application/pdf'  \n     – iv_filename     = '<name>.pdf'.  \n2. The older on-premise class CL_BCS offers the same function, but the individual fields (OBJTP, OBJDES, SIZE, CONTENT) are handed over directly (sap_help_lookup).  \n3. After at least one attachment is added and a main body was set (SET_MAIN), SEND (or SEND_ASYNC) transmits the mail (sap_documentation_summary).\n\nSelf-contained sample code (cloud-ready CL_BCS_MAIL_MESSAGE)\n\n```abap\nDATA: lv_pdf_xstring TYPE xstring.          \"your PDF comes in here\n\nTRY.\n    \"1) Build the mail object\n    DATA(lo_mail) = cl_bcs_mail_message=>create_instance( ).\n\n    lo_mail->set_sender  ( 'noreply@example.com' ).\n    lo_mail->add_recipient( 'customer@example.com' ).\n\n    \"2) Main body (HTML or text)\n    lo_mail->set_main(\n      cl_bcs_mail_textpart=>create_text_html(\n        '<p>Dear Customer,<br>Your invoice is attached.</p>' ) ).\n\n    \"3) Additional PDF attachment\n    lo_mail->add_attachment(\n      cl_bcs_mail_binarypart=>create_instance(\n        iv_content_bin  = lv_pdf_xstring\n        iv_content_type = 'application/pdf'\n        iv_filename     = 'Extra_Information.pdf' ) ).\n\n    \"4) Send it\n    lo_mail->send( ).       \"or SEND_ASYNC and then COMMIT WORK\n  CATCH cx_bcs_mail INTO DATA(lx_mail).\n    \"handle errors\nENDTRY.\n```\n\nEquivalent classic CL_BCS snippet (on-premise)\n\n```abap\nDATA: lv_pdf_xstring TYPE xstring,\n      lo_send_request TYPE REF TO cl_bcs,\n      lt_pdf          TYPE solix_tab.\n\n\"convert XSTRING to SOLIX_TAB\ncl_document_bcs=>xstring_to_solix( EXPORTING i_xstring = lv_pdf_xstring\n                                   IMPORTING et_solix   = lt_pdf ).\n\nlo_send_request = cl_bcs=>create_persistent( ).\n\n\"main body\nDATA(lo_doc) = cl_document_bcs=>create_document(\n                 i_type    = 'HTM'\n                 i_subject = 'Mail Subject'\n                 i_text    = VALUE bcsy_text( ( line = '<p>Body</p>' ) ) ).\n\nlo_send_request->set_document( lo_doc ).\nlo_send_request->add_recipient( i_email = 'customer@example.com' ).\n\n\"PDF attachment\nlo_send_request->add_attachment(\n   i_attachment_type    = 'PDF'\n   i_attachment_subject = 'Extra Information'\n   i_attachment_size    = xstrlen( lv_pdf_xstring )\n   i_att_content_hex    = lt_pdf ).\n\nlo_send_request->send( ).\nCOMMIT WORK.      \"required in classic API\n```\n\nPlain-language takeaway  \n“Put your PDF into an XSTRING, create a binary body-part with content-type ‘application/pdf’, call ADD_ATTACHMENT, then send—the e-mail will reach the customer with the extra PDF attached.”",

System landscape and tooling  \n   • You are running SAP S/4HANA Cloud, public edition in a 3-system landscape (DEV/TEST/PROD).  \n   • Developer Extensibility is enabled; you work in ADT (Eclipse) with an ABAP cloud project.\n\n2. Licences and subscriptions  \n   • A valid licence for SAP Document and Reporting Compliance.  \n   • An active subscription to SAP Integration Suite (Cloud Integration), because every new process exchanges XML messages through an integration flow.\n\n3. Authorisations  \n   • The developer needs the SAP-provided dev spaces; the business tester/operator needs business catalog SAP_SD_BC_GLO_EDOC_PC (covers the Fiori apps “eDocument Cockpit”, “Manage Electronic Documents”, “Schedule eDocument Jobs”, App Extensibility).\n\n4. Governance / project setup (internal DRC Cloud guideline)  \n   • An approved “new-process” issue in the drc/process-integration GitHub repository and alignment with the DRC Cloud architecture team.  \n   • After approval, you request access to the shared Cloud Integration tenant and create a dedicated content package for your process.\n\n5. Integration basics  \n   • Communication User/Arrangement is already set up so that S/4HANA Cloud can call the integration flow endpoint once it exists.\n\nWithout the above items the “Create New Process” tutorial in the DRC extensibility guide cannot be executed (customising entries cannot be saved, ABAP classes cannot be transported, and the XML payload cannot reach the service).\n\nPlain-language summary  \nBefore you build a new e-invoicing (or other e-document) process in DRC Public Edition, you need the correct public-cloud landscape, the DRC and Integration Suite licences, the right Fiori/business roles, and project approval plus access to the shared Cloud Integration tenant.\n\nExample checklist snippet  \n☑ S/4HANA Cloud (3-system) tenant available  \n☑ Developer Extensibility workspace in ADT  \n☑ DRC licence | Integration Suite subscription active  \n☑ Business catalog SAP_SD_BC_GLO_EDOC_PC assigned to tester  \n☑ “New-process” issue approved in drc/process-integration repo  \n☑ CI tenant access + empty package “My_New_Process” created\n\nOnce all boxes are ticked you can follow the help-portal guide “Developing a New Process” to define the eDocument type, implement the ABAP process class, configure value mappings, and deploy the integration flow.",

Prerequisites  \n    • Import the SSL-client certificate that SAP BTP generated for your DRC service instance and create a corresponding PSE entry (Help Portal “Importing SSL Client Certificates”).  \n    • Copy the endpoint URL that appears in the service key / service binding of the DRC instance (for example …​hana.ondemand.com/edo/ubl/v1).  \n    • Make sure the required consumer proxy objects were generated in the backend (if a proxy does not appear in SOAMANAGER, run transaction SPROXY_START – see KBA 2772510). [edp_troubleshooting_search, C1.34]\n\n2. Open SOA Management  \n    Transaction SOAMANAGER → Service Administration → Web Service Configuration.\n\n3. Find the process-specific consumer proxy  \n    • Enter the proxy pattern delivered for the new DRC process, e.g.  \n      CO_EDO_RO_E_DOCUMENT_RO (Romania)  \n      CO_EDO_PL_KSEF_TRANS_SERV_V1 (Poland)  \n      CO_EDO_UBL_SEND_CRED_NOTE_V1_0 (UBL generic)  \n    • Press Go and highlight the proxy in the result list. [sap_documentation_summary, chunks 1 & 2]\n\n4. Create a logical port  \n    • Choose “Create → Manual Configuration”.  \n    • Specify Logical-Port Name and description; SAP recommends the pattern shown in the guides, e.g.  \n      EDO_RO_E_DOCUMENT_SERV_PORT,  \n      EDO_UBL_SEND_CRED_NOTE_SERV_PORT.  \n    • Keep Messaging Protocol “SOAP 1.1” (default).  \n    • In the “Transport Settings” tab paste the full endpoint URL copied from the BTP service key.  \n    • In “Consumer Security” pick “SSL” and assign the previously imported SSL client certificate.  \n    • Save and “Ping Web Service”. A HTTP 405 reply is expected and confirms reachability. [sap_documentation_summary, logical-port steps 4-7]\n\n5. Repeat for every proxy that belongs to the process  \n    Many DRC processes require two proxies (one for “send”, one for “retrieve status”), each with its own logical port; repeat the above steps accordingly.\n\n6. Final check  \n    Submit a test eDocument from the Fiori app “Manage Electronic Documents”. If the proxy and logical port are correct, the document leaves the cockpit without the runtime error “No logical port … exists”.

(If not yet delivered) define the business-system type  \n   • SSCUI 101807 “Define Business System Type”  \n   • Add the type you will reference later, e.g. “INT_SUITE”.\n\n4.

Create the communication arrangement that binds the interface to an SAP COM* scenario  \n   • Fiori app “Communication Arrangements” → New → choose the appropriate scenario  \n     – For most eInvoicing processes: SAP_COM_0521 (e-Document Communication)  \n     – Pick the communication system from step 2.  \n     – The arrangement will automatically propose the user from step 1 and generate an Arrangement ID (keep it for BRFplus).  \n   • Press “Check Connection” – status should be green.\n\n6. Link the interface to the custom DRC process in the finance SSCUIs  \n   • SSCUI 105024 “Assign Program Parameters” – assign your Communication Interface ID (“ZCI_PEP”) to the eDocument process code (e.g. “ZPEP”) and runtime program variant.  \n   • SSCUI 105025 “Assign Company Codes” – list every company code that will use the new interface.  \n   • SSCUI 105026 / 105027 – if the process is VAT-relevant, assign tax codes or map tax conditions.\n\n7. Make the interface reachable from Output Management  \n   • Fiori app “Output Parameter Determination” (or SSCUI 104233)  \n   • Add / adjust the rule so that the new eDocument type “ZPEP” calls the communication arrangement ID created in step 5.\n\n8.

Testing path (DEV → Q → P)  \n   1. Unit test GENERATE_EDOCUMENT via ABAP Test Classes or /nADT preview.  \n   2.

         "Technical explanation  \n• In SAP S/4HANA Cloud, public edition (the platform on which DRC runs), customers are not allowed to create their own ABAP Dictionary tables with SE11 or any classic development tool.  \n• The permitted way to persist custom data is the Fiori app “Custom Business Objects (CBO)”.  \n  – When you publish a CBO, the system generates a persistent table named /BOBF/<hash>.  \n  – That generated table appears in the value help of the “Database Tables/Views” field when you define a DRC (Statutory Reporting) Query.  \n• Therefore, for a new-country process you:  \n  1. Model the required fields in a Custom Business Object and publish it (optionally enable “Service Generation” or “Reporting”).  \n  2. Open Define Statutory Reports → Queries → Add Query and choose Data Source Type = Database Tables/Views.  \n  3. Select the generated /BOBF/… table as the Data Source Name and continue with the usual parameter/filter mapping.  \n• No other DB artefact types (custom CDS views, HANA CalcViews, direct ABAP tables) can be created in the public-cloud tenant, and none are needed—the CBO table fully meets DRC data-source requirements.\n\nPlain-language takeaway  \nYou cannot create an ABAP table yourself in Public Cloud; instead you create a Custom Business Object, and the system builds an internal table that DRC can use.\n\nMini example  \n1. App “Custom Business Objects” → Create  \n   • ID: ZCNTRY_SAF_TAX  \n   • Fields: COUNTRY (key), TAX_CODE, TEXT  \n   • Publish  \n2. DRC → Define Statutory Reports → Queries → Add  \n   • Data Source Type: Database Tables/Views  \n   • Data Source Name: /BOBF/ZZZZZZZZZZ (generated by step 1)  \n3.

Always declare the UUID field exactly as `EDOC_UUID` or `SYSUUID_C32`; never shorten it.  \n2. Keep the table type #REGULAR; in Public Cloud you cannot use pooled/cluster tables.  \n3. Avoid direct foreign-key relationships to SD/FI tables; use domains only (cloud extensibility rule).  \n4. After transport, register the table in Fiori app “Manage eDocument Type” → Tab “Extension Tables”; the framework will then automatically fill and delete the table via BAdI `EDOCUMENT_BASE_EXT`.  \n5. Implement interface `IF_EDOCUMENT_EXT_*` (usually methods `PROCESS_CREATE`, `DELETE_FROM_DB`, …) in your country handler class to read/write the table.\n\nPlain-language summary  \nCreate a normal ABAP Cloud table with MANDT + EDOC_GUID as keys and any additional fields you need; the DRC framework will populate it once you link the table to the eDocument type in configuration.",

Tell the framework which class to call (BAdI EDOCUMENT_BASE_EXT)  \n   • Enhancement spot ES_EDOCUMENT_EXT → create implementation with filter Country/Region = ‘XX’.  \n   • Method determine_edocument_class:  \n     cv_edoc_class_name = ‘ZCL_EDOC_EXT_<XX>’.  \n   • Method determine_process: supply the process name/version you will model in step 5.\n\n3. (If outbound web-service integration is needed) implement BAdI EDOCUMENT_INT_CONN_EXT  \n   • The handler normally calls io_edocument_ext_es→process_req_send_global( … ) which in turn triggers this BAdI.  \n   • Provide the HTTP/SOAP logic here or reuse SAP API Management arrangements.\n\n4.

Good practices / constraints  \n   • Only one active implementation of EDOCUMENT_BASE_EXT per country/region + source document.  \n   • Always propagate errors via io_edocument_ext_es→add_message_application_log and raise CX_EDOCUMENT_EXT—keeps eDocument cockpit consistent.  \n   • Persist custom data only in your own Z-tables; remove it in process_delete if implemented.  \n   • Unit-test with “Manage Electronic Documents” or cockpit; trace with SLG1 (object EDOCUMENT) or ST05.  \n\nShort example snippets\n\nBAdI implementation (EDOCUMENT_BASE_EXT)  \nMETHOD if_edocument_base_ext~determine_edocument_class.  \n  cv_edoc_class_name = 'ZCL_EDOC_EXT_US'.  \nENDMETHOD.\n\nCountry handler class skeleton  \nCLASS zcl_edoc_ext_us DEFINITION PUBLIC FINAL.  \n  PUBLIC SECTION.  \n    METHODS process_create  \n      IMPORTING iv_interface_guid   TYPE if_edoc_ext_datatypes=>mty_interface_edoc_guid  \n                iv_process_step     TYPE if_edoc_ext_datatypes=>mty_edoc_process_step  \n                iv_variant          TYPE if_edoc_ext_datatypes=>mty_edoc_proc_step_var  \n                io_edocument_ext_es TYPE REF TO cl_edocument_ext_es  \n      RETURNING VALUE(rv_result)    TYPE if_edoc_ext_datatypes=>mty_edoc_process_step  \n      RAISING   cx_edocument_ext.  \n    METHODS handleException …  \nENDCLASS.\n\nMETHOD process_create.  \n  io_edocument_ext_es->process_create_global( … RECEIVING rv_result = rv_result ).  \nCATCH cx_edocument_ext INTO lx.  \n  handleException( io_edocument_ext_es = io_edocument_ext_es  \n                   ix_edocument_ext    = lx ).  \nENDMETHOD.\n\nPlain-language takeaway  \nYou build a small ABAP class (one per country) that wraps the standard eDocument framework calls; a BAdI then tells the framework to use that class, and you register the class and its methods in Fiori configuration apps so the new country process runs end-to-end in SAP Document and Reporting Compliance.",

         "Technical explanation  \nYes. In SAP S/4HANA Cloud, public edition, you can ship an ABAP class that participates in Document & Reporting Compliance (DRC) “process mapping” by using the Developer-Extensibility BAdIs delivered in the electronic-document framework.  \nThe key vehicle is enhancement spot ES_EDOCUMENT_CLOUD and its BAdIs—for mapping tasks the most relevant is EDOC_ADAPTOR_CLOUD. When you create an enhancement implementation in ADT (Eclipse-based ABAP Development Tools), the wizard generates an ABAP class that implements the released interface. Inside that class you may\n\n• decide whether an eDocument is created (method IS_RELEVANT)  \n• alter or append XML segments that the framework/AIF will later transmit  \n• fill or modify custom fields (used together with EDOC_CUSTOM_FIELDS_* BAdIs)  \n\nPrerequisites and limits (from SAP Help & DRC extensibility FAQ)  \n• Public-cloud system must run in the 3-system DEV/Q/P landscape so that Developer Extensibility is enabled.  \n• Your user needs role SAP_BR_DEVELOPER.  \n• Only released objects and APIs may be used; runtime blocks unreleased ones.  \n• You adapt the standard mapping; creating an entirely new mapping runtime in ABAP is not supported—use DMEE-EX or AIF objects plus the above BAdIs.  \n• No classic SE18/SE19; all work is done in ADT.  \n\nQuick implementation outline  \n1. In ADT → New → Enhancement Implementation → enter ES_EDOCUMENT_CLOUD.  \n2. Choose BAdI EDOC_ADAPTOR_CLOUD → maintain filter values (e.g. Country = ‘IN’).  \n3. ADT generates class ZCL_EDOC_ADAPT_IN_GSTR (example).  \n4. In the method CHANGE_XML: read importing structure, change CHANGING xml_table, activate.  \n5. Transport to Q and P; test via Fiori app EDOC_COCKPIT.\n\nExample snippet (simplified)  \n```ABAP\nMETHOD if_edoc_adaptor_cloud~change_xml.\n  LOOP AT xml_table ASSIGNING FIELD-SYMBOL(<l_xml>) WHERE node_name = 'TotalAmount'.\n    <l_xml>-value = |{ lv_new_amount ALPHA = IN }|.\n  ENDLOOP.\nENDMETHOD.\n```\n\nPlain-language summary  \nYou can indeed write and deploy an ABAP class in S/4HANA Cloud public edition to tweak DRC’s XML mapping—do it by implementing the EDOC_ADAPTOR_CLOUD BAdI (and related BAdIs) in the Developer Extensibility environment.",

SAP help for “Develop a new process for electronic outgoing invoices” (help link 0d46ab8519… ) and “Create an eDocument Base Class Extension” (help link 40ae8e6e86…) list the mandatory and optional Business Add-Ins (BAdIs).\n\n1. Mandatory BAdI – executed for every document of the new process  \n   • EDOCUMENT_BASE_EXT  \n     – Enhancement spot: ES_EDOCUMENT_EXT  \n     – Purpose: tells the framework which eDocument Process ID to use and which custom handler class (sub-classing IF_EDOCUMENT_PROCESS) shall run for the selected country/company code.  \n     – Without it, the process is never recognised; only the last active implementation per country is executed, so create exactly one filter entry (e.g. Country = “US”, Process ID = “YY1_PEPPOL”).  \n     SAP Help evidence (tool output 1 & 2).\n\n2. Recommended/typical BAdIs for a new process (optional but almost always needed)  \n   • EDOC_ADAPTOR_CLOUD  \n     – Adds or changes XML mapping before the file is sent; can also stop creation entirely.  \n     Evidence: SAP Help “Enhancing the standard XML file…” (tool output “eDocument mapping BAdI public cloud mapping extension”).  \n\n   • EDOC_CUSTOM_FIELDS_CLOUD  \n     – Fills the structure CUSTOM_FIELDS so that additional data reaches the XML and database tables.  \n   • EDOC_CUSTOM_FIELDS_UI_CLOUD  \n     – Makes those custom fields visible/editable in the “Manage Electronic Documents” Fiori app.  \n     Evidence: same help chapter and GitHub extensibility guide (tool outputs).\n\n   • EDOC_PROCESS_EXT  \n     – Lets you adjust internal status flow, perform extra validations, or enrich the EDOCUMENT table after it is built.  \n     Evidence: GitHub extensibility guide (tool output “BAdI EDOC_PROCESS_EXT…”).\n\n   • EDOCUMENT_INT_CONN_EXT  \n     – Needed only if you build your own HTTP/SOAP/RFC call instead of SAP’s Integration Suite flow; called from method PROCESS_REQ_SEND_GLOBAL.  \n     Evidence: SAP Help “Communication with web services” (tool output 3).\n\nRelationship to your ABAP classes  \n• In EDOCUMENT_BASE_EXT you return the name of your own handler class (e.g. zcl_yy1_edoc_us).  \n• That class must implement IF_EDOCUMENT_PROCESS (and usually IF_EDOCUMENT_MAPPER) and can delegate mapping to EDOC_ADAPTOR_CLOUD.  \n\nMinimal deliverables for a working custom process  \n1. One EDOCUMENT_BASE_EXT implementation (filtered for country/process).  \n2. One custom handler class implementing IF_EDOCUMENT_PROCESS.  \nOptional but almost always present: an EDOC_ADAPTOR_CLOUD implementation for mapping.\n\nPlain-language summary  \nTo get a brand-new electronic-document process running in DRC Public Cloud you MUST implement BAdI EDOCUMENT_BASE_EXT, and you will usually also implement EDOC_ADAPTOR_CLOUD for XML mapping plus EDOC_CUSTOM_FIELDS* and EDOC_PROCESS_EXT for extra data or status logic; further, use EDOCUMENT_INT_CONN_EXT only if you build your own outbound communication.",

Country/region handler class  \n   Method IF_EDOCUMENT_BASE_EXT~DETERMINE_EDOCUMENT_CLASS  \n   → export CV_EDOC_CLASS_NAME = name of your subclass of CL_EDOCUMENT_EXT_ES (e.g. ‘ZCL_EDOC_US’).\n\n2. eDocument process name and version  \n   Method IF_EDOCUMENT_BASE_EXT~DETERMINE_PROCESS  \n   → export  \n      CV_PROCESS_NAME    = process you modelled in “Manage eDocument Process” (e.g. ‘Z_E_INVOICE’)  \n      CV_PROCESS_VERSION = ‘0001’ (or other version).\n\nOnly when both values are returned does the framework generate the eDocument header/item records and hand control to your country handler.  \n\nCall sequence & constraints  \n• All active implementations are executed sequentially; the result of the LAST one is taken.  \n• Because CL_EDOC_FACTORY_EXT can generate only a single eDocument instance, you must ensure only one active implementation per (filter) country/region.  \n\nConfiguration steps in brief  \n1. Create an enhancement implementation for spot ES_EDOCUMENT_EXT and a BAdI implementation for EDOCUMENT_BASE_EXT.  \n2. Maintain a filter value (SAP key COUNTRY) = target country/region.  \n3. In IMG / SSCUI “Activate Additional eDocument Instance Creation”, register factory class CL_EDOC_FACTORY_EXT for each source document type that shall trigger your process.\n\nResult  \nAt runtime the framework now knows “which handler + which process” to start, so your custom eDocument flow is executed automatically.\n\nPlain-language summary  \nEDOCUMENT_BASE_EXT tells SAP which custom program should handle an electronic document and which process definition to use; without it, no custom eDocument can be created.",

         "Technical explanation (step-by-step)\n\n1. Prerequisites in SAP S/4HANA Cloud (Public Edition)\n   • eDocument Framework and Spain country scope item (‏4XU‏) are activated in your tenant.  \n   • You already created:  \n     – eDocument type (for example ES_EINV) in SSCUI “Create eDocument Types”.  \n     – Country-specific handler class (sub-classing CL_EDOCUMENT_EXT_ES) in ABAP Cloud development.  \n     – Process definition and steps for ES_EINV in the “Manage eDocument Process” app.  \n     – Factory class CL_EDOC_FACTORY_EXT is registered for the relevant source document (e.g. SD_INVOICE) in SSCUI “Activate Additional eDocument Instance Creation”.\n\n2. Create the enhancement implementation\n   1. In ABAP Development Tools choose  \n      File → New → ABAP Repository Object → Enhancement Implementation.  \n   2. Enter:  \n      Enhancement Spot  ES_EDOCUMENT_EXT  \n      Implementation     Z_ES_EDOC_BASE_ES (name of your choice).\n\n3. Add the BAdI implementation\n   • Inside the enhancement implementation add a BAdI implementation for EDOCUMENT_BASE_EXT.  \n   • Implementation class     ZCL_EDOC_BASE_ES.  \n\n4. Maintain the BAdI filter  \n   Filter name     COUNTRY  \n   Filter value    ES  \n   (Optional: add SOURCE_TYPE = ‘SD_INVOICE’ if you want it to react only for billing documents.)\n\n5. Code the two mandatory interface methods\n\n```abap\nCLASS zcl_edoc_base_es DEFINITION\n  PUBLIC FINAL CREATE PUBLIC.\n  PUBLIC SECTION.\n    INTERFACES if_badi_interface.\n    INTERFACES if_edocument_base_ext.\nENDCLASS.\n\nCLASS zcl_edoc_base_es IMPLEMENTATION.\n\n  \"1. Tell the framework which handler class to instantiate\n  METHOD if_edocument_base_ext~determine_edocument_class.\n    cv_edoc_class_name = 'ZCL_EDOC_ES_HANDLER'.   \"your country handler\n  ENDMETHOD.\n\n  \"2. Tell the framework which process applies for the source document\n  METHOD if_edocument_base_ext~determine_process.\n    IF is_edocument-source_type = 'SD_INVOICE'.   \"billing doc\n      cv_process_name    = 'ES_EINV'.   \"eDocument type\n      cv_process_version = '0001'.      \"version in Process Manager\n    ENDIF.\n  ENDMETHOD.\n\nENDCLASS.\n```\n\n6. Activate\n   • Activate the class, the BAdI implementation and the enhancement implementation.  \n   • Only one active EDOCUMENT_BASE_EXT implementation may exist for COUNTRY = ‘ES’. Make sure no second one is active.\n\n7. Configuration checklist (SSCUI / Fiori)\n   • Activate Additional eDocument Instance Creation → enter CL_EDOC_FACTORY_EXT for SD_INVOICE.  \n   • Create eDocument Type (ES_EINV) and assign it to business object SD_INVOICE.  \n   • Manage eDocument Process → verify steps and assign methods of ZCL_EDOC_ES_HANDLER.  \n   • Activate Source Document Type per company code (SSCUI 104043).  \n\n8. Test\n   1. Post a billing document.  \n   2. Framework calls CL_EDOC_FACTORY_EXT → your BAdI → handler class → process flow.  \n   3. Record appears in table ZEDOC_ES and in the “Manage Electronic Documents” app.  \n   4. Run “Submit” and remaining legal-reporting steps.\n\nKey points for Spain\n• COUNTRY filter = ‘ES’ is mandatory so the Spanish logic is picked.  \n• Only two small methods are required in the BAdI; all business rules live in the handler class ZCL_EDOC_ES_HANDLER.  \n• Without the factory-class registration the BAdI is never called.  \n• In Public Cloud the entire development (enhancement + classes) is done in the ABAP Cloud project space delivered for extensibility.\n\nPlain-language summary\nCreate an enhancement for spot ES_EDOCUMENT_EXT, add BAdI EDOCUMENT_BASE_EXT with filter COUNTRY = ES, program two short methods that (a) name your Spanish handler class and (b) tell the framework which eDocument process to run, then activate and test—this links Spanish billing documents to the Spain e-Invoicing process in S/4HANA Cloud.",

         "Technical explanation (based on the two SAP-Help excerpts above)\n\n1. What an “eDocument Type” is  \n   • It is the key customizing object (table EDOCC_DOC_TYPE) that represents one legal/compliance process in Document & Reporting Compliance (DRC).  \n   • The type stores the runtime parameters of that process – country/region, submission scenario, XML mapping variant, communication channel, AIF interface, validation rules, etc.  \n   • Cockpit apps (EDOC_COCKPIT / Manage Electronic Documents) read this value to select the right monitoring layout and follow-up actions.\n\n2. Why you must create it for every new process you build with DRC extensibility  \n   • Unique process identifier – The system needs a new code to distinguish your custom process from SAP-delivered ones (sap_documentation_summary [1]).  \n   • Trigger logic – You map the eDocument Type to source document categories (FI, SD, MM-IV, Delivery, Settlement…) via SSCUIs “Assign eDocument Type to …”. Only after the mapping exists will the posting of those documents automatically create an eDocument (sap_help_lookup §2b).  \n   • Parameter container – All other extensibility artefacts (value mappings, cloud communication flag, number ranges, multiple-instance factory class, etc.) are stored per eDocument Type (sap_help_lookup §3).  \n   • Multi-process flexibility – A single country/source-document combination can legally require several electronic documents (e.g. invoice vs. credit note vs. transport registration). Separate eDocument Types let you keep those flows apart and run them in parallel (sap_documentation_summary [1]).  \n   • Monitoring & analytics – Filters, job scheduling variants and status values in the cockpit use the eDocument Type field; without it you cannot monitor or resend the new process correctly.\n\n3. How it is created in SAP S/4HANA Cloud, public edition  \n   Role needed: SAP_BR_BPC_EXPERT.  \n   a. Activate the source document for your company code.  \n   b. Run the relevant “Assign eDocument Type to …” SSCUI and enter a new eDocument Type code (e.g. Z_AR_INV).  \n   c. Optionally maintain “Define Process Communication Through Cloud Services” and value-mapping SSCUIs.  \n   (All steps are listed under sap_help_lookup §2 and §3.)\n\nShort example  \n• You need to send Peppol order responses from SD credit-memo billing documents.  \n  – Create eDocument Type Z_PEPO_SDOR (Process: PEPPOL_ORDER_RESPONSE).  \n  – Map SD billing document type CR to Z_PEPO_SDOR in SSCUI “Assign eDocument Type to Billing Document Type”.  \n  – Maintain XML field mapping and communication arrangement.  \n  Result: when a CR document is posted, DRC generates an electronic “Order Response” that appears in the cockpit under type Z_PEPO_SDOR.\n\nPlain-language takeaway  \nYou create an eDocument Type because it is the “name tag” that links your source documents to all the metadata, mapping rules, and monitoring needed for a new electronic-document process; without that tag the system cannot recognise, create, or track the new compliance flow.",

         "Technical explanation  \nTo let an external (non-SAP) or SAP Document and Reporting Compliance, cloud edition system push XML/JSON documents into your SAP S/4HANA Private Cloud tenant you must prepare one inbound “landing zone” in S/4HANA and one outbound path to the service.  The required settings are identical to on-premise and are described in the Initial Setup / Integration with Cloud Edition guides (scope item 78L).  The key objects are summarised below.\n\nSettings in SAP S/4HANA Private Cloud\n\n1. Scope activation  \n   • Activate scope item 78L “SAP Document and Reporting Compliance, Cloud Edition – Integration” (or import BC-Set /EDOCUMENT/LHC_78L).  \n\n2. RFC destinations (SM59)  \n   a) Type G (HTTP) EDOC_CLOUD – URL of your BTP / DRC endpoint.  \n   b) Logon & Security tab: SSL client PSE and TLS certificate of the endpoint.  \n\n3. Inbound bgRFC destination (SBGRFCCONF)  \n   • Create EDOC_BG_INBOUND (type INBOUND).  \n   • Register it and assign a queue prefix /EDOC/* (SPRO → Cross-Application Components → SAP Document and Reporting Compliance → Foundation → Integration with Cloud Edition → Define Queue Names).  \n\n4. HTTP service activation  \n   • SICF → activate /sap/bc/bgrfc so that inbound HTTP calls are accepted.  \n\n5. Cloud Connector / Connectivity  \n   • In Cloud Connector expose the virtual host/port that corresponds to /sap/bc/bgrfc.  \n   • Map it to your S/4HANA Private Cloud internal host.  \n\n6. Communication arrangement (SOAMANAGER or Communication Management apps)  \n   • Create a service user and an inbound service (typically “DRC_INBOUND_PUSH_SRV”).  \n   • Use the Cloud Connector virtual host & HTTPS port.  \n\n7. SAP Application Interface Framework (AIF)  \n   • Activate the /EDOC/ namespace and interfaces supplied by the content package (transaction /AIF/CUST).  \n\n8. Certificate trust (STRUST)  \n   • Import the root/intermediate certificates that sign the DRC/BTP endpoint and assign them to the SSL client PSE used by EDOC_CLOUD.  \n\n9. Test program  \n   • Run report /EDOCUMENT/EDOC_TEST_CONN – all traffic lights must be green (outbound call and inbound callback).  \n\n10. Country/format specific customizing  \n    • Follow the “Integration Steps” link in the Supported Compliance Tasks list (e.g. Peppol, Spain TicketBAI, India B2B) to finish mapping tables, partner IDs, and validation profiles.\n\nMini–checklist snippet\n\nSM59 → EDOC_CLOUD  \n  Target Host : drc-cf.<region>.hana.ondemand.com  \n  Path Prefix : /api/v1/edoc  \n  SSL        : ANONYM SSL Client (Standard)  \nSBGRFCCONF → EDOC_BG_INBOUND  \n  Queue Prefix : /EDOC/*  \n  Dest. Type   : INBOUND  \nSICF → /sap/bc/bgrfc  → “Activate”  \n\nWhat happens at runtime  \n1. External system → DRC cloud → HTTPS → your Cloud Connector.  \n2. Cloud Connector forwards to /sap/bc/bgrfc → bgRFC queue /EDOC/IN_<GUID>.  \n3. Queue is processed by destination EDOC_BG_INBOUND, AIF interface updates EDOCUMENT tables.  \n4. Users see the document and its status in “Manage Electronic Documents” / “eDocument Cockpit”.\n\nPlain-language summary  \nCreate one outbound HTTP RFC and one inbound bgRFC destination, activate the bgrfc HTTP service, trust the TLS certificates, and open the path through Cloud Connector—once these pieces are in place your private-cloud SAP system can safely receive electronic documents sent from an external platform.",

         "Technical explanation  \n• Yes – SAP Document and Reporting Compliance for Greece delivers a dedicated BAdI that lets you change the XML of a customer invoice immediately before it is handed over to the myDATA authority interface.  \n• BAdI name in SAP Fiori: “Cloud EDOC Adaptor BADI: Modify final invoice XML”  \n  – Technical ID GL_EDOC_ADAPTOR (enhancement spot ES_EDOC_ADAPTOR, interface IF_EDOC_ADAPTOR).  \n  – Called after the AIF mapping has produced the XML, but before the XML is sent to SAP Integration Suite or PI/PO, so your code sees the complete document and can still block transmission.  \n• What you can do inside the method IF_EDOC_ADAPTOR~MODIFY_FINAL_XML:  \n  – Add elements that the standard mapping leaves blank.  \n  – Overwrite any value supplied by SAP’s mapping logic.  \n  – Run your own checks; if a check fails, fill ct_return with an error (type ‘E’) and raise exception CX_EDOC_BADI_ERROR. The eDocument stops in status “Rejected by BAdI” and you see the message in the cockpit / SLG1.  \n• Activation & development path  \n  1. Open Fiori app “Custom Logic” (ID F1481) or GUI trx SCFD_EUI.  \n  2. Filter for Business Context “eDocument: Greece” and choose the BAdI above.  \n  3. Create an implementation and write ABAP such as:\n\n```\nMETHOD if_edoc_adaptor~modify_final_xml.          \"io_xml_doc : XSTRING\n  DATA(lo_xml) = cl_xml_document=>create_with_xml_string( io_xml_doc ).\n\n* Example – fill PaymentTerms if missing\n  DATA(lo_pay) = lo_xml->find_node( '/Invoice/PaymentTerms' ).\n  IF lo_pay IS INITIAL.\n    lo_xml->create_simple_node(\n      parent = lo_xml->find_node( '/Invoice' )\n      name   = 'PaymentTerms'\n      value  = '30D' ).\n  ENDIF.\n\n* Example – custom validation\n  DATA(lo_vat) = lo_xml->find_node( '/Invoice/TotalVAT' ).\n  IF lo_vat IS INITIAL OR lo_vat->get_value( ) = '0'.\n    APPEND VALUE #( type = 'E' id = 'EDOC_GR' number = '001'\n                    message = 'VAT amount must be greater than zero' )\n           TO ct_return.\n    RAISE EXCEPTION TYPE cx_edoc_badi_error.      \"stops submission\n  ENDIF.\n\n  cv_xml_doc = lo_xml->render( ).                \"return modified XML\nENDMETHOD.\n```\n\n• Result: The XML stored in table EDOC_XML and forwarded to the authorities already contains your changes.  \n• Note: Do NOT break the XSD that myDATA expects; otherwise submission will fail at the authority.  \n• Complementary exits exist for earlier steps (VAT classification, invoice-type derivation, etc.), but GL_EDOC_ADAPTOR is the last hook before dispatch.\n\nPlain-language take-away  \nYou can insert or change anything in the Greece invoice XML through the GL_EDOC_ADAPTOR BAdI; it runs just before the file leaves S/4HANA, so it’s the right place for final tweaks or blocking wrong data.",

         "Technical explanation – checklist of prerequisite steps\n\n1. Commercial & system enablement  \n   • Hold an active license for “SAP Document and Reporting Compliance” and a subscription to “SAP Integration Suite”.  \n   • Run on a supported release (SAP S/4HANA Cloud 2402 or higher or the corresponding on-premise SP) and make sure the core DRC scope items and the target-country scope item are activated in SAP Central Business Configuration (CBC).  \n\n2. System landscape & tools  \n   • Work in a 3-system landscape (DEV/TEST/PROD).  \n   • Install/enable ABAP Development Tools (ADT in Eclipse) if developer extensibility will be used.  \n\n3. Technical communication setup  \n   • Create or update the Communication User and Communication Arrangement (typically scenario SAP_COM_0469 or the country-specific SOAP/REST scenario) so that the back-end can call SAP Integration Suite.  \n   • Ensure the web-service runtime and ICM/HTTPS are up and trusted certificates are in place.  \n\n4. Authorizations for key-user extensibility  \n   • Assign the following Fiori business catalogs / roles to the extensibility key user:  \n     – SAP_CORE_BC_EXT (or role SAP_BR_BPC_EXPERT) — UI Adaptation.  \n     – SAP_CORE_BC_EXT_CF (app F1481 “Custom Fields & Logic”).  \n     – SAP_CORE_BC_CONFIG_UPLOAD (app F3473 “Upload Business Configuration”).  \n\n5. UI adaptation readiness (optional)  \n   • “Key-User Adaptation” must be enabled in SAP Fiori Launchpad (Administration → Adapt UI = On).  \n\n6. Custom Fields & Logic framework preparation  \n   • Extensibility scope “Cross-Application” has to be switched on in CBC.  \n   • For data extensions choose the business contexts “Electronic Document – Header” or “Electronic Document – Item”.  \n   • After publishing a custom field, run “Refresh Metadata” so that the field is available in app F4306 (Manage Electronic Documents).  \n\n7. Error-handling configuration upload (optional but recommended)  \n   • Make SSCUI 105058 “Define Error Categories for Error Analysis” available in the project scope.  \n   • Prepare the Excel template and be ready to load it with app “Upload Business Configuration”.  \n\n8. Notification channel (optional)  \n   • Activate SMTP / e-mail in Communication Arrangement SAP_COM_0010 so error notifications for the new process can be mailed to users.  \n\n9. Development guidelines for new process content  \n   • Be aware that any custom field you add becomes visible in all DRC processes (no process-specific filter yet).  \n   • Use BAdI EDOC_DOCUMENT_AUTHORITY_CHECK if you need to limit visibility or processing of documents created by the new process.  \n\nPlain-language summary  \nBefore you start building your own electronic-document process in SAP Document & Reporting Compliance, make sure the DRC license and Integration Suite are in place, the country scope item is switched on, ADT or key-user tools are available, communication arrangements between S/4HANA and Integration Suite are working, and the key user has the roles to adapt the UI, add custom fields, and mass-upload configuration such as error categories.

Code Example: The answer includes a detailed coding pattern example for Peppol UBL 3.0, which is more specific and helpful than the expert answer.\n\n4. Comprehensive Coverage: It covers multiple aspects such as handling multiple files, size limits, alternatives for large files, and activation/testing procedures.\n\n5. Technical Accuracy: The answer correctly explains how to embed files using Base64 encoding and the relevant XML structure (AdditionalDocumentReference).\n\n6. Alignment with Tool Context: The information provided aligns well with the tool's output, which mentions using BAdI methods to add attachments to the standard XML.\n\n7. Plain Language Summary: The answer concludes with a concise, easy-to-understand summary of the process.\n\nOverall, the generated answer not only meets but exceeds the quality of the expert answer, providing more detailed, technically accurate, and implementation-ready information.",

         "Technical explanation (Private-Cloud edition of SAP Document & Reporting Compliance)  \n1. Where to add the file  \n   • You enrich the XML in the “XML-filling” BAdI, not in EDOC_ADAPTOR itself.  \n     – Invoice: IF_EDOC_EU_XML_INVOICE~FILL_XML_FILE  \n     – Credit Note: IF_EDOC_EU_XML_CREDIT_NOTE~FILL_XML_FILE  \n   • The BAdI is available in SE18/SE19 or the Fiori “Custom Logic” app (Business Context = Document Compliance).\n\n2. Runtime sequence  \n   a) Source document is posted → eDocument is created.  \n   b) Framework calls the XML-filling BAdI → you receive IMPORT parameter XML_FILE and must return EXPORT parameter XML_FILE_MODIFIED.  \n   c) EDOC_ADAPTOR-SET_OUTPUT_DATA picks up XML_FILE_MODIFIED and sends it.  \n   ⇒ Anything you embed in XML_FILE_MODIFIED becomes part of the final outbound XML.\n\n3.

Multiple files  \nAPPEND several lines to XML_FILE_MODIFIED-additional_document_reference; each line becomes one AdditionalDocumentReference element.\n\n5. Size limits & alternatives  \nPeppol AS4 normally limits the whole message to ~10 MB. For larger material compress, split, or reference with a cbc:URI instead of embedding.\n\n6. Activation & test  \n• Activate the BAdI implementation.  \n• Open “Manage Electronic Documents”, pick the eDocument, choose “Simulate Output” → the generated XML now shows your <AdditionalDocumentReference> with the embedded file.  \n• In productive run jobs (program EDOC_ADPROCESSING_PDL) the same logic is executed automatically.\n\nPlain-language takeaway  \nCreate a BAdI implementation that copies the generated XML and adds an AdditionalDocumentReference node containing the Base64 of your file; the framework automatically forwards this enriched XML to the authority or Peppol network.",

         "3",
         "Technical explanation (step-by-step)\n\n1. Identify the correct BAdI  \n   • In S/4HANA Private Cloud the enhancement spot is ES_EDOCUMENT_CLOUD.  \n   • Use BAdI EDOC_ADAPTOR_CLOUD (alias of the older EDOC_INTERFACE_CONNECTOR_GR).  \n   • Filter value COUNTRY = ‘GR’.\n\n2. Create the enhancement in ADT (ABAP Development Tools)  \n   a. ADT → New → Enhancement Implementation.  \n   b. Enter Enhancement Spot ES_EDOCUMENT_CLOUD and choose BAdI EDOC_ADAPTOR_CLOUD.  \n   c. Maintain filter COUNTRY = ‘GR’; leave other filters blank unless an SAP Note instructs otherwise.  \n   d. ADT generates a class (e.g. ZCL_EDOC_ADAPT_GR) that implements IF_EDOC_ADAPTOR_CLOUD.\n\n3. Implement the required methods  \n   • MODIFY_OUTBOUND_XML (or MODIFY_FINAL_INVOICE_XML in older SPs)  \n     – CHANGING parameter CS_XML holds the complete XML string/DOM.  \n     – Add, change, or remove nodes; then return the new XML.  \n   • (Optional) VALIDATE_XML – perform custom checks, add errors to CT_RETURN.  \n   • (Optional) IS_EDOCUMENT_RELEVANT – suppress creation for special cases.\n\n   Example snippet:\n\n   ```\n   METHOD if_edoc_adaptor_cloud~modify_outbound_xml.\n     DATA(lo_dom) = cl_xml_document=>create_with_xml( cs_xml ).\n     DATA(lo_inv) = lo_dom->find_node( name = 'invoices' ).\n     IF lo_inv IS BOUND.\n       DATA(lo_extra) = lo_dom->create_element( name = 'ExtraInfo' ).\n       lo_extra->set_value( 'Custom text' ).\n       lo_inv->append_child( lo_extra ).\n       cs_xml = lo_dom->render( ).\n     ENDIF.\n   ENDMETHOD.\n   ```\n\n4. Test the enhancement  \n   • Create or select a billing/FI document → run “Create eDocument”.  \n   • Open app EDOC_COCKPIT → choose your record → Document Details → XML tab; the new elements should appear.  \n   • If needed, press “Resubmit” to re-execute the BAdI.  \n   • Monitor errors in AIF (/AIF/ERR).\n\n5. Transport and go-live  \n   • The enhancement object is collected in a standard ABAP transport.  \n   • Move through the PCE landscape as usual; no additional CPI/iFlow change is necessary because the XML is already final before it leaves SAP.\n\nRelevant objects/structures available inside the BAdI  \n   – IS_EDOC_HEADER : eDocument header (EDOC_ID, PROCESS_ID, etc.)  \n   – IS_SOURCE_DOCUMENT : billing (VBRK) or FI header  \n   – CS_XML / CT_XML_NODES : full XML / individual nodes  \n   – CT_RETURN : messages (BAPIRET2) displayed in cockpit\n\nTypical Greece (myDATA) use-cases achieved with this approach  \n   • Fill <fuelFlag>, <invoiceVariationType>, <hashMark>, or other myDATA-specific tags.  \n   • Derive invoice type, VAT or income/expense classification using additional BAdIs delivered for Greece.  \n   • Block submission for certain billing types or incomplete data.\n\nOne-sentence plain-language summary  \n“In a Private-Cloud system you enhance the Greek e-invoice XML by creating an ADT BAdI implementation (EDOC_ADAPTOR_CLOUD with filter GR), changing the XML in the MODIFY_OUTBOUND_XML method, and then testing the result in the eDocument cockpit before it is sent to the tax authority.”",

In SAP S/4HANA Private Cloud you can enhance the standard “eDocument – Customer Invoice (IT_FATTURA)” process that SAP delivers for Italy.  \nAll extension points are officially supported and remain in the customer (-Y) namespace, so they survive upgrades.\n\nHow you extend the process  \n\n1. ABAP/BAdI layer  \n   • Enhancement spot EDOCUMENT_IT  \n     – BAdI ITALY_XML_FILE_FILLING   (Change or inject nodes/attributes in the generated Fattura PA XML)  \n     – BAdI ITALY_ATTACHMENTS_TO_XML   (Add PDF or other files as Base64 to the XML)  \n   • Generic BAdI EDOCUMENT_PARTNER_CNCTR   (Compute recipient e-mail or PECDestinatario code).  \n   • Implement the BAdI in the Fiori “Custom Logic” app or transaction SCFD_EUI → activate → transport.\n\n2. Customizing the scope of the extension  \n   SPRO / CBC path: Cross-Application Components → SAP Document and Reporting Compliance → eDocument  \n   – Define Interface Type for eDocument (table EDOC_INTERFACE)  \n   – Map Accounting Doc-Types to EDOC-Type ‘IT_FATTURA’  \n   – Maintain number ranges and add company-code parameters (Codice Destinatario default, REA no., Regime Fiscale, …).\n\n3. Integration layer  \n   No PI/PO is required; the XML you altered is still handed to the standard SAP Integration Suite iFlow “eInvoicing for Italy”.  \n   If you need a different access-point or signature service you simply copy the iFlow and switch INTERFACE_TYPE in the ABAP header.\n\n4. Operation  \n   • Job EDOC_OUT_PROC_START – sends the modified XML.  \n   • Job EDOC_IN_MSG_PULL – imports SdI feedback which the cockpit shows with your custom tags still intact.\n\nCode snippet (BAdI ITALY_XML_FILE_FILLING – add a custom withholding tag)  \n\nMETHOD modify_xml. \n  DATA(lo_xml) = cl_sxml_document=>create_from_xstring( is_xml ).\n  DATA(lo_root) = lo_xml->find_name( 'FatturaElettronicaHeader' ).\n  \"Insert new tag <RitenutaCustom> \n  lo_root->add_child( cl_sxml_node=>create_simple( name = 'RitenutaCustom'\n                                                   value = 'SI' ) ).\n  es_xml = lo_xml->to_xstring( ).\nENDMETHOD.\n\nHelpful SAP Notes: 2887314 (XML filling) | 2877205 (attachments).  \n\nPlain-language summary  \nYou can absolutely tailor the Italian e-invoice flow in Private Cloud—SAP delivers open BAdIs and customizing so you can add or change XML fields, attachments, routing, or recipient data while still using the standard cockpit and Integration Suite content.",

         "Technical explanation  \n• In S/4HANA Cloud, private-edition the list of buttons that appear in the eDocument Cockpit (Submit, Cancel, Get Status, …) is hard-coded by SAP in table EDOC_ACTIONS and the framework class CL_EDOC_ACTION_FACTORY.  \n• SAP has released several in-app BAdIs (visible in the “Custom Logic” Fiori app) for eDocument processes, but none of them expose EDOC_ACTIONS or allow you to register a new cockpit action. The officially released BAdIs are limited to:  \n  – deciding whether an eDocument must be created,  \n  – enriching/validating the XML before “Submit”,  \n  – adding custom database/UI fields.  \n• Neither SE18/SE19 enhancement spots nor classic configuration views for EDOC_ACTIONS are delivered in the Cloud extensibility scope. Therefore you cannot:  \n  – create your own action code (e.g. Z_SUBMIT_TO_PORTAL),  \n  – add a new button to the cockpit toolbar,  \n  – change the sequence or visibility of standard actions by code.  \n• If you build a custom eDocument process (Z-process) you can only assign the standard action catalogue that SAP already delivers; the framework shows those actions automatically once the process has entries in EDOC_ACTIONS (SAP content transport).  \n• Work-arounds endorsed by SAP documentation:  \n  – Put your additional logic in an existing action (e.g. inside the BAdI “Cloud EDOC Adaptor: Modify Final XML” that runs during SUBMIT).  \n  – Trigger the custom function outside the cockpit: a Fiori app or a background job calling the released OData service API_EDOCUMENT_SRV.  \n  – Raise an SAP Influence request / OSS incident if you need a “released” BAdI for new actions.\n\nExample  \nWanted: “Archive” button in the cockpit for a bespoke clearance portal.  \nNot possible: No released API to add ARCHIVE to EDOC_ACTIONS.  \nFeasible alternative: Keep the standard SUBMIT button, implement BAdI CLD_EDOC_MODIFY_FINAL_XML to send the file to both the legal endpoint and your archive, or create a custom Fiori tile that calls API_EDOCUMENT_SRV/archive.\n\nPlain-language summary  \nIn SAP S/4HANA Cloud, private-edition you cannot add or change buttons (actions) in the eDocument Cockpit; you can only use SAP’s standard actions and place any extra logic in the published BAdIs or a separate app.",

         "Answer (technical)  \nYes. In SAP S/4HANA Private-Cloud you can extend both the “Manage Electronic Documents” Fiori app and the legacy “eDocument Cockpit” (EDOC_COCKPIT) by adding your own fields through in-app (key-user) extensibility:\n\n1. Create the field  \n   • Fiori app “Custom Fields” → Business Context “Document Compliance – eDocument Header (CE_EDOC_HDR)” or “…Item (CE_EDOC_ITEM)” → New field YY1_… → Publish.  \n   • The system generates DDIC include YY1_EDOC_HDR_CF or YY1_EDOC_ITEM_CF that is automatically appended to the eDocument tables (EDOCUMENT / EDOCUMENT_ITEM).\n\n2. Persist and expose the field  \n   • Fiori app “Custom Logic” → Business Context “Document Compliance”.  \n   • Implement BAdI “eDocument Custom Fields” (technical name: EDOCUMENT_CUSTOM_FIELDS).  \n     – Method APPEND_FIELDS: add your YY1_* field to ct_extension_fields so it is stored with every new eDocument.  \n   • Optional: Implement BAdI “eDocument Custom Fields (UI)” to make the column appear in the cockpit list/detail view (set label, position, tooltip in ct_ui_fields).\n\n3. Pass the field to the outbound XML (if required)  \n   • Implement BAdI “Cloud EDOC Adaptor BADI: Modify Final Invoice XML” (/S4EDOC/CL_EAI_MODIFY_FINAL_INV).  \n     Example (excerpt):  \n     ```\n     DATA(lt_edoc) = edoc_data->get_header( ).\n     READ TABLE lt_edoc INTO DATA(ls_hdr) INDEX 1.\n     IF ls_hdr-yy1_shiptolocation IS NOT INITIAL.\n       xml->set_value(\n         exporting\n           xpath = '/Invoice/Shipment/ShipToID'\n           value = ls_hdr-yy1_shiptolocation ).\n     ENDIF.\n     ```\n\n4. Activate, transport, and test  \n   • Create/submit an invoice, open EDOC_COCKPIT: the new column is visible and filterable; open XML preview to see the new node if mapped.\n\nNo additional SPRO activity is needed; the cockpit UI automatically reads the extended structures.  SAP Note 4489457 contains a full step-by-step example and sample code.\n\nPlain-language takeaway  \nYes—you can add your own columns to the eDocument cockpit in private-cloud; just create the field, implement the supplied BAdIs, and it will be stored, displayed, and (optionally) sent in the XML.",

Perform the runtime check  \n   • Implement BAdI “Perform Authorisation Checks to Restrict Visibility of Electronic Documents” (delivered in 2302).  \n\n```abap\nMETHOD if_edoc_auth_check~check_authority.\n  AUTHORITY-CHECK OBJECT 'Z_EDOCORG'\n         ID 'ORGUNIT' FIELD is_edoc_hdr-zzsalesorg\n         ID 'ACTVT'   FIELD '03'.        \"display\n  IF sy-subrc <> 0.\n    ev_visible = abap_false.             \"hide record in cockpit\n  ENDIF.\nENDMETHOD.\n```\n\n5. Transport the extension (include, CDS-extension, BAdIs, auth-object, role) to Q and P systems and test with users that have / don’t have the role.\n\nResult  \nWhen a user opens the eDocument Cockpit the framework executes your BAdI; only the documents whose custom-field value is authorised for that user are listed, effectively controlling visibility based on any criterion you choose (sales org, plant, branch, etc.).\n\nPlain-language takeaway  \nYes—by adding a custom field and a small BAdI, you can make the eDocument Cockpit show each user only the electronic documents they are allowed to see in SAP S/4HANA Private Cloud.",
