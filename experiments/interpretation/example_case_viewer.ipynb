These BAdIs allow you to customize aspects such as bank account data, delivery note fields, discount/charge reasons, correction invoice reason codes, and partner reference fields in the eInvoice XML.\\n- The eDocument Cockpit and Manage Electronic Documents apps are the primary interfaces for processing and monitoring electronic documents in the Public Cloud.\\n- The troubleshooting search did not reveal any explicit restrictions against using these extensibility options in the Public Cloud for Spain. However, it did highlight that certain advanced or non-standard functionalities (such as Invoice List processing or proforma invoice handling) are not supported out-of-the-box and would require submitting requests through SAP\\u2019s Customer Influence program if needed.\\n\\nTechnical Explanation:\\n- Extensibility is achieved via SAP-provided BAdIs, which are accessible through the Custom Logic app in the Public Cloud. These BAdIs are specifically designed for the Spanish eInvoicing scenario and allow you to inject custom logic at predefined points in the eDocument process.\\n- You cannot make arbitrary changes to the core process or underlying framework, but you can influence the data and logic relevant to your business needs within the supported extension points.\\n\\nPlain-Language Summary:\\n- Yes, you can extend the eDocument customer invoice process in Spain as a Public Cloud customer, but only within the boundaries set by SAP. You can use SAP\\u2019s built-in tools to add custom logic for certain fields and behaviors, but if you need changes outside of what is supported, you must request them through SAP\\u2019s official channels.\\n\\nExample:\\n- If you need to add a custom reason code for a correction invoice, you can implement this using the relevant BAdI in the Custom Logic app.\\n- If you want to change how the delivery note number is filled in the XML, you can do so via the provided extension point.\\n\\nLimitations:\\n- You cannot change the overall process flow or add unsupported document types (like Invoice List or proforma invoices) without SAP\\u2019s involvement.\\n- All extensions must use the officially provided BAdIs; direct modification of SAP standard code is not possible in Public Cloud.\",\n",

      "• No on-prem ABAP modifications or classic SE19 are required; everything is done in the Fiori extensibility apps and is upgrade-safe.  \n",
      "• To ensure the extensions run, activate the Spain eDocument type in the SSCUIs, assign it to your accounting/billing document types, and (for Veri*Factu) switch on the new feature toggle nodes delivered by SAP.  \n",
      "• At runtime the framework calls your BAdI code during XML generation and again when a corrective invoice is submitted. Any errors you raise appear in the UI’s Error Analysis pane.\n",
