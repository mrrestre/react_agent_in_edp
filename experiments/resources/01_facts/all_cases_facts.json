By enhancing the XML file, you can include additional information that may be relevant for your business processes, such as the customer material number in the billing document. To enhance the XML file, you can use the method SET_OUTPUT_DATA of the Business Add-In (BAdI) EDOC_ADAPTOR_CLOUD. This BAdI allows you to modify XML tags and fill optional XML tags with values. You can create a new implementation class for the BAdI and implement the necessary logic to modify the XML tags. Once you have implemented the BAdI, you can activate it. After the XML file is enhanced, it can be sent to the authorities as part of the Germany customer invoice process.",

We use the VAT ID for participant-ID. If we try to create it with the same participant-ID, we get an error because of the same VAT-ID in our participant-ID.",

Instead of using VAT IDs, consider using a more flexible identifier such as the Global Location Number (GLN). GLNs can be used across different systems without causing conflicts. This approach is particularly useful when you have multiple systems or company codes that need to be uniquely identified.
