In your ABAP project, go to the enhancement spot ES_EDOCUMENT_CLOUD and select 'New BAdI Enhancement Implementation'.\n2. Enter a package, name, and description for the implementation.\n3. Choose 'Add BAdI Implementation' and select EDOC_ADAPTOR_CLOUD .\n4. (Optional) Create a BAdI filter for Country and\/or Generic Filter.\n5. Choose 'Implementing Class' to create a new implementation class.\n6. Activate your BAdI implementation .\nOnce you have implemented the BAdI, you can fill the XML tag <BuyersItemIdentification> with the desired additional information.\nThis can be done by reading the relevant data from the source documents and filling the appropriate XML tags.\nPlease note that the specific implementation details may vary depending on your system setup and requirements.\nIt is recommended to refer to the provided sources for more detailed instructions and examples."

The incorrect URL path that has been determined is '\/cxf\/PeppolLookup', which is causing the error when trying to display HTML. We assume this comes from the currently registered logical port in EDOSOASERV.\nTo resolve this issue, the correct logical port and URL path need to be determined and updated in the SOA Manager configuration. The correct logical port to be maintained is 'EDO_DCS_DCP_GENERC_WEBSERVICE'.\nPlease follow these steps:\n1. Access SAP and navigate to 'SM30 -> EDOSOASERV (Defining SOA Services for Communication)'.\n2. Search for 'EU_GENERIC_WEBSERV' and specify 'EDO_DCS_DCP_GENERC_WEBSERVICE'.\n3.
