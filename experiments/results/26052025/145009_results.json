    "generated_answer": "Validation Step:\n\n- The `sap_documentation_summary` provided general extensibility options for DRC in the public cloud.\n- The `sap_help_lookup` discussed data migration and staging tables but didn't directly address custom database table creation.\n- The `edp_troubleshooting_search` provided troubleshooting notes related to table views and other errors, but it did not directly address the creation of custom database tables for DRC extensibility.\n\nThe information gathered does not explicitly confirm or deny the possibility of creating custom database tables for DRC extensibility in the public cloud. However, the absence of explicit documentation or troubleshooting guidance on creating custom database tables, combined with the emphasis on extensibility options like custom fields and side-by-side extensions, suggests that direct creation of database tables might not be the standard or recommended approach. It is possible that custom tables can be created using the Developer Extensibility option, but this is not explicitly stated.\n\nFinal Answer:\nBased on the available documentation, it's not explicitly clear whether you can directly create database tables for DRC extensibility in the public cloud. The documentation focuses on extensibility options like custom fields, side-by-side extensions using SAP BTP, and the use of staging tables for data migration. While Developer Extensibility might allow for custom table creation, this is not explicitly confirmed.\n\nTherefore, while not definitively ruled out, creating custom database tables directly within the public cloud environment for DRC extensibility might not be the standard or recommended approach. Consider exploring the documented extensibility options like custom fields and side-by-side extensions using SAP BTP as alternatives. If custom tables are required, investigate the Developer Extensibility option and consult SAP documentation or support for specific guidance.\n",

    "generated_answer": "The `edp_troubleshooting_search` tool did not return any specific limitations related to *extending* eDocument processes in Spain's public cloud. The results are more generic, covering issues in other countries or general eDocument processing errors. This suggests that extending the eDocument process in Spain's public cloud, while requiring careful configuration and BAdI implementation, doesn't have widespread, documented limitations.\n\nValidation Step:\n\n*   `sap_documentation_summary` provided an overview of extension possibilities using BAdIs.\n*   `sap_help_lookup` confirmed the availability of specific BAdIs for Spain and highlighted the mandatory BAdI for correction invoices.\n*   `edp_troubleshooting_search` did not find specific limitations for extending eDocument processes in Spain's public cloud.\n\nThe information gathered supports the conclusion that extending an existing eDocument customer invoice process in the Public Cloud in Spain is possible, primarily through the use of BAdIs. The absence of specific troubleshooting results related to limitations suggests that while configuration and implementation require careful attention, there are no known widespread blocks to this process.\n\nFinal Answer:\nYes, as a Public Cloud customer in Spain, you can extend an existing eDocument customer invoice process. This is primarily achieved through the use of Business Add-Ins (BAdIs) available in the Custom Logic app. These BAdIs allow you to customize aspects like filling bank account data, delivery note fields, discounts and charges reasons, and determining reason codes for correction invoices. The \"Spain: Determine Reason Code\" BAdI is mandatory for handling correction invoices. You can use the eDocument Cockpit app to process and submit eDocuments. While no specific limitations were found regarding extending eDocument processes in Spain's public cloud, careful configuration and BAdI implementation are crucial. For example, you can use the \"Spain: Filling of Bank Account Data\" BAdI to specify the IBAN for receiving invoice payments.\n",
