    "generated_answer": "2.5. Validation Step:\n   - The `sap_documentation_summary` tool confirms that authorization control based on organizational units can be implemented in the \"Manage Electronic Documents\" app.\n   - The process involves extending the app with custom fields, defining relevant organizational units, and using a restriction type to limit access.\n   - The authorization approach is consistent across both the eDocument Cockpit and the Manage Electronic Documents app.\n3. Final Answer:\nYes, you can restrict the visibility of eDocuments in both the \"Manage Electronic Documents\" app and the \"eDocument Cockpit\" app using customer-specific authorizations. This involves extending the apps with custom fields to incorporate organizational units from source documents (like billing or accounting documents). By defining relevant organizational units and processes, and then implementing a restriction type such as \"Electronic Document: Restriction for Organizational Unit,\" you can control which users have access to specific electronic documents based on their organizational affiliation. This ensures that employees can only access documents relevant to their organizational unit. For example, you can add a custom field for \"Sales Organization\" and then restrict access so that users in Sales Organization A can only see documents related to Sales Organization A. The process is similar for both apps, ensuring a consistent approach to authorization control.\n",

    "generated_answer": "2.5. Validation Step:\n\n*   `sap_documentation_summary`: Provided a general overview of Greece customer invoice processing, highlighting the use of AIF and SAP Cloud Integration/Integration Suite.\n*   `sap_help_lookup`: Confirmed the possibility of extending the XML using BAdIs within AIF, specifically the \"Cloud EDOC Adaptor BADI: Modify final invoice XML\".\n*   `edp_troubleshooting_search`: Identified potential issues related to special characters in the XML file and BAdI implementations, providing relevant SAP Notes for resolution.\n\nThe information from `sap_help_lookup` expands on the initial overview from `sap_documentation_summary` by providing specific details about the BAdIs available for XML modification. The `edp_troubleshooting_search` adds a cautionary layer by highlighting potential issues and solutions. The answer has been confirmed and expanded with supporting information.\n\n3.  Final Answer:\n\nYes, you can enhance or extend the generated XML for Greece customer invoices in the Public Cloud before it is sent to the authorities.\n\nTechnically, this is achieved using the Application Interface Framework (AIF) and specifically the \"Cloud EDOC Adaptor BADI: Modify final invoice XML\". This BAdI allows you to modify the final invoice XML, fill in missing fields, change values of existing fields, and check the XML content for errors. You can implement custom logic within this BAdI to meet specific requirements.\n\nFor example, you can use the BAdI to:\n\n*   Add custom fields required by the Greek tax authority that are not included in the standard XML.\n*   Modify the format of existing fields to comply with myDATA specifications.\n*   Implement validation checks to ensure the XML content is correct before submission.\n\nHowever, be aware of potential issues such as special characters in the XML (addressed by restricting them in master data or filtering them using the `SET_OUTPUT_DATA` method from BADI `EDOC_ADAPTOR`) and the unavailability of the `IS_ADDITIONAL_INFO` parameter in the `EDOC_ADAPTOR` BAdI (resolved by implementing SAP Note 2777017).\n\nIn plain language, this means that you have the ability to customize the electronic invoice (XML file) before it's sent to the Greek tax authorities. SAP provides tools that allow you to add information, change existing information, and check for errors in the invoice. This ensures that the invoice meets all the requirements of the Greek tax authorities. However, you need to be aware of potential technical issues and how to resolve them.\n",
