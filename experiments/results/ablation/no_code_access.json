    "answer": "To attach additional files to the standard XML in Public Cloud, you can use the Business Add-In (BAdI) EDOC_ADAPTOR_CLOUD and enhance the XML file generated for an electronic document.\nBy enhancing the XML file, you can include additional information that may be relevant for your business processes .\nTo implement this enhancement, you can follow these steps in ABAP Development Tools (ADT):\n1. In your ABAP project, go to the enhancement spot ES_EDOCUMENT_CLOUD and select 'New BAdI Enhancement Implementation'.\n2. Enter a package, name, and description for the implementation.\n3. Choose 'Add BAdI Implementation' and select EDOC_ADAPTOR_CLOUD .\n4. (Optional) Create a BAdI filter for Country and/or Generic Filter.\n5. Choose 'Implementing Class' to create a new implementation class.\n6. Activate your BAdI implementation .\nOnce you have implemented the BAdI, you can fill the XML tag <BuyersItemIdentification> with the desired additional information.\nThis can be done by reading the relevant data from the source documents and filling the appropriate XML tags.\nPlease note that the specific implementation details may vary depending on your system setup and requirements.\nIt is recommended to refer to the provided sources for more detailed instructions and examples.",

    "agent_judge_reasoning": "The generated answer is fully helpful and accurately addresses the question. It aligns well with both the expert answer and the additional context provided by our tools. Here's why:\n\n1. Correctness: The answer correctly states that it is possible to enhance or extend the generated XML for Greece customer invoices in SAP S/4HANA Cloud, public edition.\n\n2. Method Identification: While the expert answer mentions the SET_OUTPUT_DATA method of BAdI EDOC_ADAPTOR_CLOUD, the generated answer provides more specific and up-to-date information. It mentions the BAdI \"Cloud EDOC Adaptor BADI: Modify Final Invoice XML\" with the business context \"eDocument: Greece\", which is consistent with our tool outputs.\n\n3. Implementation Details: The generated answer provides more comprehensive information on how to implement the enhancement, including:\n   - Using the Fiori app \"Custom Logic\" for implementation\n   - Explaining that you receive the complete XML in parameter CV_XML (XSTRING)\n   - Mentioning that you can change, add, or delete nodes/values\n   - Noting that the file must still validate against the myDATA XSD delivered by SAP\n\n4. Additional Information: The answer goes beyond the expert answer by providing:\n   - Information on supported non-coding adaptations (Value Mapping app)\n   - What is not possible or unsupported\n   - A quick how-to example with sample code\n\n5. Alignment with Tool Outputs: The information in the generated answer is consistent with the sap_documentation_summary tool output, which mentions using BAdIs for enhancement and the integration with SAP Document and Reporting Compliance.\n\nIn conclusion, the generated answer provides a more comprehensive, detailed, and up-to-date response than the expert answer, while still maintaining accuracy and relevance to the original question.

Here's why:\n\n1. Accuracy: The generated answer correctly states that Actions cannot be extended in Public Cloud, which aligns with the expert answer.\n\n2. Comprehensive explanation: The answer provides a detailed technical explanation of why this isn't possible, mentioning that the list of Actions is hard-coded in SAP tables (EDOC_CACT or EDOC_ACTIONS) and not exposed for customization.\n\n3. Extensibility limitations: It clearly outlines the limits of SAP's released extensibility for Document Compliance, which includes adding custom fields and injecting logic during certain processes, but not creating or modifying cockpit actions.\n\n4. Alternative solutions: The answer goes beyond just saying \"no\" and provides helpful alternatives for custom processing, such as creating a separate RAP/Fiori app or using standard job templates.\n\n5. Alignment with tool output: While the tool output suggests some extensibility options, it doesn't contradict the answer. The generated answer correctly interprets that these extensions don't allow for adding new Actions in the eDocument Cockpit.\n\n6. Clear structure: The answer is well-structured with a technical explanation, a plain-language summary, and examples of alternatives, making it easy for the user to understand the limitations and possible workarounds.\n\nIn conclusion, the generated answer fully addresses the question, provides accurate information, and offers valuable alternatives, making it fully helpful to the user.",

In private-cloud tenants they are protected against customer maintenance (modifiable only by SAP Support).  \n\u2022 Result: you may enrich or validate the data that an existing action executes (for example with Cloud EDOC_ADAPTOR_BADI, EDOC_GR_* BAdIs, etc.), but you cannot add a new cockpit action or change the sequence/visibility of the delivered ones for a self-developed eDocument process.  \n\u2022 Only in pure on-premise deployments (or P-edition systems that SAP explicitly opens via a modification key) can you:  \n  1. Implement BADI_EDOC_PROCESS_CONTROLLER in SE18/SE19,  \n  2. Create a custom Z-class that executes your logic,  \n  3. Create a new process-step/action entry in the above EDOC* tables.  \n  This path is outside the supported scope of S/4HANA Cloud, private edition.\n\nExample for what IS possible in P-edition  \n\u2022 Add a new XML tag before SUBMIT is executed:  \n  \u2013 Fiori \u25ba Custom Logic \u25ba Business Context \u201cDocument and Reporting Compliance\u201d \u25ba BAdI \u201cCloud EDOC Adaptor: Modify Final Invoice XML\u201d.  \n  \u2013 Code: `et_edoc_xml = z_my_enhance_xml( it_edoc_xml ).`\n\nExample for what is NOT allowed  \n\u2022 Trying to create a new cockpit button \u201cARCHIVE\u201d:  \n  \u2013 Customizing view V_EDOPROCFUNC \u2192 \u201cNew Entries\u201d \u2192 error message \u201cObject belongs to SAP namespace\u201d.  \n  \u2013 SE18 \u25ba BADI_EDOC_PROCESS_CONTROLLER \u2192 \u201cCreate\u201d \u2192 greyed-out because unreleased.\n\nConclusion  \nNo \u2013 in S/4HANA Cloud, private edition you cannot extend or add a cockpit action; you are limited to the actions delivered by SAP. Only data-level exits supplied in the Custom Logic app are supported. On-premise systems remain the only deployment where BADI_EDOC_PROCESS_CONTROLLER can legally be implemented to introduce custom actions.\n\nPlain-language summary  \nYou can change what an existing button does, but you cannot add your own new button to the eDocument Cockpit in the private-cloud version of SAP.",

In SAP S/4HANA Cloud (public edition) both Fiori apps\u2014Manage Electronic Documents (F4306) and the classic eDocument Cockpit\u2014can be enhanced with your own fields by using the standard \u201ckey-user\u201d and \u201cdeveloper\u201d extensibility framework delivered with release 2402 and higher.\n\nKey-user steps  \n1. Create the field  \n   \u2022 App: Custom Fields \u2192 Create  \n   \u2022 Business Context: Electronic Document Header or Electronic Document Item  \n   \u2022 Enable Usage for  \n     \u2013 UIs \u2192 Manage Electronic Documents  \n     \u2013 (optionally) CDS views / APIs if the value must reach the XML message  \n   \u2022 Publish the field.  \n2. Place the field on the UI  \n   \u2022 Open Manage Electronic Documents \u2192 Adapt UI  \n   \u2022 Drag the field into the table list or the \u201cDocument Details\u201d area and save the variant.  \n3. (Optional) Derive the value automatically  \n   \u2022 App: Custom Logic  \n   \u2022 Enhancement spot EDOC_HEADER_FLD_MAPPING (or other process-specific spots)  \n   \u2022 Implement ABAP code that copies data from the source document (e.g. VBRK) into your new field.  \n4. (Optional) Transfer the field to the outbound XML  \n   \u2022 Generic e-Invoicing/Peppol: Configuration activity \u201cMap Fields to XML File\u201d \u2192 link the UBL/Peppol element to the custom field.  \n   \u2022 Brazil NF-e/NFS-e: Implement BAdI NFE_CLOUD_EXTENSIBILITY \u2192 method ADD_FIELDS to append the data to the NF-e structure.  \n5. (Optional) Restrict visibility by organisation  \n   \u2022 Use restriction type EDO_ORG in Maintain Business Roles to limit access based on the content of your (possibly custom) org-unit field.\n\nDeveloper extensibility (for 3-system tenants)  \n\u2022 Same custom field creation, but you can implement ABAP classes for BAdIs (e.g. IF_NFE_CLOUD_EXTENSIBILITY) in ADT/Eclipse for advanced mapping or validation logic.\n\nApplicability  \n\u2022 Available in public-cloud tenants as of SAP S/4HANA Cloud 2402 (no switch needed).  \n\u2022 Works for all processes handled by Document and Reporting Compliance: Peppol, EU VAT, Brazil NF-e/NFS-e, etc.  \n\u2022 No modification of SAP objects; everything is upgrade-safe.\n\nShort example  \n1. Add field \u201cReason for Zero VAT\u201d (type CHAR40) in context Electronic Document Header.  \n2. Place it in the Document Details section.  \n3. In Custom Logic:  \n   ```\n   lv_reason = select single begru        \n               from vbrk where vbeln = is_source-vbeln. \n   es_extension-reason_zero_vat = lv_reason.\n   ```  \n4. In \u201cMap Fields to XML File\u201d map the UBL element `<cac:TaxCategory><cbc:TaxExemptionReason>` to field `EXT_REASON_ZERO_VAT`.\n\nPlain-language takeaway  \nYou can safely add your own columns or data fields to the Manage Electronic Documents (or eDocument Cockpit) app in SAP S/4HANA Cloud, show them on the screen, fill them with custom logic, and even include them in the legally required XML\u2014no custom coding outside the standard extensibility framework is needed.",

Create the restriction field  \n   \u2022 Fiori app \u201cCustom Fields\u201d (F1481) \u2013 Business Context = Document Compliance \u2192 e.g. field Z_ORG_UNIT (type Code/Text).  \n   \u2022 Publish the field. It is automatically added to the CDS views and OData service used by the cockpit apps.\n\n2. Populate the field when the eDocument is generated  \n   \u2022 Fiori app \u201cCustom Logic\u201d (F1482)  \n   \u2022 Implement BAdI EDOC_CUSTOM_FIELDS_CLOUD to fill the persistence field, e.g.  \n     `Z_ORG_UNIT = billing_document-sales_org.`  \n   \u2022 (Optional) implement BAdI EDOC_CUSTOM_FIELDS_UI_CLOUD to expose the value in the UI column.\n\n3. Activate the authorisation object  \n   \u2022 No extra coding: once the field is published, it becomes eligible in the delivered authorisation object \u201cElectronic Document: Restriction for Organisational Unit\u201d.\n\n4. Maintain role-based restrictions  \n   \u2022 Fiori app \u201cBusiness Catalogs\u201d \u2192 locate SAP_SD_BC_GLO_EDOC_PC and note the business roles that use it.  \n   \u2022 Fiori app \u201cMaintain Business Roles\u201d (F1368) \u2192 Maintain Restrictions \u2192 object \u201cElectronic Document: Restriction for Organisational Unit\u201d.  \n   \u2022 For each role select the eDocument process (billing, accounting, etc.), pick the custom field (Z_ORG_UNIT), and enter the allowed values (e.g. 1000, 2000).\n\n5.

Locate the cloud-replacement BAdI that controls whether an electronic document is generated:  \n   Enhancement spot ES_EDOCUMENT_CLOUD \u2192 BAdI EDOC_ADAPTOR_CLOUD (successor of on-premise EDOCUMENT_CREATE_CHECK).  \n2. In ABAP Development Tools (ADT) create a new enhancement implementation:  \n   \u2022 File \u2192 New \u2192 Enhancement Implementation  \n   \u2022 Choose spot ES_EDOCUMENT_CLOUD and select BAdI EDOC_ADAPTOR_CLOUD  \n   \u2022 Provide implementation name, short text, and a global class (e.g. ZCL_EDOC_SKIP_ES).  \n3.

The generated answer offers two specific examples of conditions to control eDocument creation: for SD billing documents with zero net value and for FI documents with specific posting key and reconciliation account. This goes beyond the expert answer, providing practical use cases.\n\n5. It includes clear instructions on how to activate the BAdI in Public Cloud, which is valuable information not present in the expert answer.\n\n6. The answer explains the result of returning abap_false, stating that it will stop the framework from generating an electronic document and that the document will not appear in the eDocument Cockpit.\n\n7. The generated answer provides both a technical explanation and a plain-language summary, making it accessible to users with different levels of expertise.\n\nIn conclusion, the generated answer is fully helpful as it not only matches the expert answer but also provides additional valuable information, examples, and implementation details that are consistent with the tool output and go beyond the initial expert answer.",

Prerequisites  \n   \u2022 Scope item 5XU \u201cDocument and Reporting Compliance \u2013 Greece\u201d is activated.  \n   \u2022 You create/monitor e-documents in the apps \u201cManage Electronic Documents\u201d or \u201ceDocument Cockpit\u201d.  \n   \u2022 You have the Key User role that allows Custom Logic and Value Mapping maintenance.\n\n2. Implement the Greece XML-adjustment BAdI  \n   a. Launchpad \u2192 app \u201cCustom Logic\u201d \u2192 Create.  \n   b. Business Context: Electronic Document (Greece) (component CA-GTF-CSC-EDO-GR).  \n   c. BAdI Name: EDOC_SINGLE_ADJUST_XML \u2013 \u201cAdjust Single XML Before Submission\u201d.  \n   d. Accept the default ABAP for Cloud draft implementation and press Create.  \n\n3. Code your enhancement  \n   The method provides a changing parameter io_xml_document (XCO XML object) that already contains SAP\u2019s standard XML. Typical actions:  \n   \u2022 Fill empty tags that the mapping left blank.  \n   \u2022 Change calculated values (e.g. rounding, alternative VAT base).  \n   \u2022 Add country-specific optional tags required by your myDATA service provider.  \n   \u2022 Perform consistency checks and, if an error is found, raise a failed message to stop processing (message appears in the cockpit log).  \n\n   Mini-example: add an extra node with an alternative supplier registration number  \n   ```abap\n   DATA(lo_root) = io_xml_document->get_root_element( ).\n   DATA(lo_header) = lo_root->get_first_child_by_name( 'InvoiceHeader' ).\n   IF lo_header IS BOUND.\n     lo_header->add_child( )->set_name( 'AltSupplierID' )->set_value( iv_alt_id ).\n   ENDIF.\n   ```\n\n4. Publish and transport  \n   \u2022 Press \u201cPublish\u201d in Custom Logic; the runtime artefact is generated.  \n   \u2022 Use Cloud Transport Management (or retrofit) if you need the logic in other tenants.\n\n5. Test the enhancement  \n   a. In \u201cManage Electronic Documents\u201d (or the cockpit) locate a document \u2192 \u201cReset to Draft\u201d.  \n   b. \u201cSubmit\u201d again.  \n   c. Open the XML preview; the new/changed tags should be present.  \n   d. If you deliberately raised an error, the processing status turns to \u201cError\u201d and the log shows your message.\n\n6. Optional value-mapping for reverse-charge VAT (new in release 2402)  \n   App \u201cValue Mapping\u201d \u2192 table REV_VAT_TRANS_KEY \u2192 list the tax transaction keys that must be excluded from VAT amounts; standard XML logic will obey this mapping. No coding is needed, but it is part of \u201cenhancing\u201d the output.\n\nPlain-language summary  \nOpen the Fiori app \u201cCustom Logic\u201d, create an implementation of BAdI EDOC_SINGLE_ADJUST_XML, write the ABAP-for-Cloud code that changes the XML, publish it, and then re-generate the XML from the eDocument Cockpit/Manage Electronic Documents app to see your adjustments.",

Paste/adjust ABAP for Cloud code, e.g.:\n\n      ```\n      \"Sample: branded subject, bilingual body, extra TXT file\n      DATA(lv_date) = |{ is_edoc_hdr-create_date DATE = ENVIRONMENT }|.\n\n      cs_email_subject = |Rechnung { is_edoc_hdr-source_doc_id } \u2013 { lv_date }|.\n\n      cs_email_body = |<html><body>|\n                      & |<p>Sehr geehrte Damen und Herren,<br>| &\n                      |please find attached your invoice.</p>| &\n                      |<p>This is an automated mail \u2013 do not reply.</p>| &\n                      |</body></html>|.\n\n      APPEND VALUE #( mimetype = 'text/plain'\n                      filename = 'Hinweis.txt'\n                      value    = 'Zus\u00e4tzliche Informationen' ) TO ct_attachment_data.\n      ```\n\n   e. Publish. After transport release the change is active in Production.\n\n4. Alternative \u2013 developer extensibility (ADT)  \n   \u2022 Create class in ADT \u2192 \u201cBAdI Implementation\u201d of EDOC_PART_CONN_CHANGE_EMAIL_V2.  \n   \u2022 Code the same logic, transport through Q to P.  \n   \u2022 Multiple implementations possible; control order with filters/priorities.\n\n5. Related configuration (if needed)  \n   \u2022 Maintain sender address in SSCUI/Fiori activity \u201cMaintain Sender/Receiver E-Mail Addresses for eDocuments\u201d (table EDOC_EMAIL_PAR).  \n   \u2022 No Output Management form is involved; all formatting is done in the BAdI.\n\n6. Typical use-cases realised with the BAdI  \n   \u2022 Add company branding and logo via HTML.  \n   \u2022 Dynamically pick different recipient lists for domestic vs. export customers.  \n   \u2022 Attach ZUGFeRD/XRechnung XML in addition to the PDF.  \n   \u2022 Provide language-specific subjects/bodies by reading customer language.  \n   \u2022 Suppress the default PDF and attach an externally signed version instead.\n\nPlain-language summary  \nUse the SAP-delivered BAdI EDOC_PART_CONN_CHANGE_EMAIL_V2, available in the \u201cCustom Logic\u201d app, to overwrite the subject line, body text, recipients and attachments of the e-mails that SAP Document & Reporting Compliance sends for German customer invoices; no output-form change is required\u2014just implement your logic, publish, and the enhanced e-mail is sent automatically.",

Two extensibility options are officially supported:\n\n1. Key-user (in-app) BAdIs  \n   \u2022 Use the Custom Logic app to implement BAdIs delivered for Document & Reporting Compliance (DRC).  \n   \u2022 Typical BAdIs:  \n     \u2013 EDOC_ADAPTOR_CLOUD \u2192 method IS_RELEVANT to decide when an invoice should create an eDocument.  \n     \u2013 Field-mapping BAdIs to populate extra XML elements (e.g. add a \u201cTax Exemption Reason\u201d in the <Notes> section).  \n   \u2022 No licence change is required; changes are transportable in the standard 2-system landscape.\n\n2. Developer Extensibility (ABAP Cloud in the 3-system landscape)  \n   \u2022 For early adopters who have an SAP Document & Reporting Compliance licence and an SAP Integration Suite subscription.  \n   \u2022 You build your own enhancement class or even a brand-new electronic document process by re-using the DRC framework (orchestration, mapping, submission, acknowledgment).  \n   \u2022 All work is done in ADT/Eclipse; only released APIs and objects can be used.\n\nWhat you cannot do  \n\u2022 Change SAP-delivered XSDs or alter the legal XML structure.  \n\u2022 Apply classic user exits or modify standard code.  \n\u2022 Upload Z-objects into the core tenant outside the released ABAP Cloud package interfaces.\n\nExample snippet (Key-user)  \nBAdI Implementation: EDOC_MAP_CUST_INVOICE  \n```\nMETHOD fill_header_extension.\n  IF is_header-tax_exempt = abap_true.\n    cs_xml-note = |Tax exempt under art. 84 VAT law \u2013 reason: { is_header-exempt_reason }|.\n  ENDIF.\nENDMETHOD.\n```\nResult: the exemption reason appears in the outgoing Facturae XML without touching SAP standard.\n\nPlain-language takeaway  \nYes\u2014SAP Public Cloud lets you add your own rules or extra fields to the Spanish e-invoice flow, using either key-user BAdIs or (for larger needs) the newer Developer Extensibility toolset, while still staying in compliance with Spain\u2019s legal Facturae format.",

Complexity: The generated answer is quite technical and may be overwhelming for users who are not familiar with SAP development. It could benefit from a more structured, step-by-step approach.\n\n2. Public Cloud specificity: While the answer does mention Public Cloud, it doesn't consistently emphasize the differences between Public Cloud and on-premises development throughout the explanation.\n\n3. Alignment with expert answer: The generated answer covers more topics than the expert answer, which is good, but it doesn't explicitly mention some key components highlighted in the expert answer, such as the Web Services Runtime and SAP Integration Suite.\n\n4. Tool-provided context: The answer incorporates some information from the tool outputs, but it doesn't fully utilize all the relevant information provided, especially regarding the landscape and tooling specific to Public Cloud development.\n\n5. Examples: While the answer includes some code snippets, it could benefit from more practical examples or use cases to illustrate the development process.\n\nOverall, the generated answer provides valuable information and covers many aspects of developing new processes for electronic documents in the EDP framework. However, it could be improved by focusing more on the Public Cloud specifics, better aligning with the expert answer, and presenting the information in a more structured and accessible manner.",

    "generated_answer": "Technical explanation (how-to)\n\n1. Prerequisites  \n   \u2022 Have a 3-system SAP S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition tenant that is enabled for Developer Extensibility (ADT in Eclipse).  \n   \u2022 Assign role SAP_BR_DEVELOPER_0070 (catalog SAP_A4C_BC_DEV_GLO_EDO_PC).  \n   \u2022 Ensure your system is already integrated with SAP Document & Reporting Compliance, Cloud Edition (communication arrangement or SAP BTP Integration Suite iFlow).\n\n2. Design the new electronic-document process  \n   \u2022 Decide the process key you want to introduce, e.g. \u201cZPROC_FIINV_EXT\u201d.  \n   \u2022 Identify the source document type(s) that shall trigger it (ACC_DOC, BIL_DOC, or a custom source type).  \n   \u2022 Decide whether the process is purely outbound, inbound, or bidirectional.\n\n3. Create ABAP objects in ADT (Developer Extensibility)  \n   a) Country/region handler class (mandatory)  \n      \u2013 ZCL_EDOC_XX_HANDLER implements IF_EDOCUMENT_EXT_ES.  \n      \u2013 Fill core methods: CREATE_EDOCUMENT, MAP_XML_DATA, PROCESS_SUBMIT / PROCESS_STATUS_REQUEST, etc.  \n   b) Optional mapping class if complex XML mapping required (e.g. ZCL_EDOC_XX_MAP).  \n   c) BAdI implementations (enhancement spot ES_EDOCUMENT_CLOUD):  \n      \u2022 EDOCUMENT_BASE_EXT                \u2013 returns PROCESS = \u2018ZPROC_FIINV_EXT\u2019 and HANDLER_CLASS = \u2018ZCL_EDOC_XX_HANDLER\u2019.  \n      \u2022 EDOCUMENT_INT_CONN_EXT            \u2013 controls the outbound call (SEND_REQUEST) to Integration Suite.  \n      \u2022 EDOC_ADAPTOR_CLOUD, EDOC_CUSTOM_FIELDS_CLOUD, EDOC_CUSTOM_FIELDS_UI_CLOUD, EDOCUMENT_MESSAGE_EXT as required.  \n   d) If you need a brand-new source type:  \n      \u2022 ZCL_EDOC_EXT_<SRC> implements IF_EDOC_SOURCE_EXTENSION (decides if document is relevant).  \n      \u2022 ZCL_EDOC_EXT_<SRC>_<PROC> implements IF_EDOC_SOURCE_PROCESS_EXT (extra mapping / filter).\n\n4. Register and configure the artefacts in Fiori (no SPRO in public cloud)  \n   \u2022 Manage eDocument Type \u2013 upload or maintain the XML schema / format definition.  \n   \u2022 Manage eDocument Process \u2013 create \u2018ZPROC_FIINV_EXT\u2019, assign source type(s), handler class, interface key.  \n   \u2022 Manage eDocument Interface \u2013 maintain service proxies / communication arrangement that points to the Integration Suite endpoint.  \n   \u2022 (Optional) Manage eDocument Message Type and status mapping table EDOMETASTATUS1V for inbound replies.  \n   \u2022 For custom source type registration use \u201cRegister Handling Classes for Source Extension\u201d.\n\n5. Test and iterate  \n   \u2022 Post a test source document (e.g. FI invoice). The EDOCUMENT_BASE_EXT logic should create an eDocument record.  \n   \u2022 Use Fiori \u201cManage Electronic Documents\u201d (or GUI EDOC_COCKPIT) to verify header & payload; execute \u201cSubmit\u201d.  \n   \u2022 Check the outbound call in SAP Document & Reporting Compliance monitor and in the Integration Suite trace.  \n   \u2022 If the authority sends a response, EDOCUMENT_MESSAGE_EXT updates status; verify that the cockpit reflects it.\n\n6. Runtime considerations  \n   \u2022 Implement RESTRICT_CANCELLATION or DELETE_FROM_DB in the handler if you want special control for cancel/delete.  \n   \u2022 To expose extra fields in the cockpit, populate CUSTOM_FIELDS structure and implement the corresponding UI BAdI.  \n   \u2022 Review IAM role catalog changes after each quarterly upgrade (note 2975653).\n\n7. Go-live checklist  \n   \u2022 Transport (gCTS) the ABAP objects and the Fiori configuration across Q- and P-systems.  \n   \u2022 Activate communication arrangement in P-system.  \n   \u2022 Provide end-user roles (e.g. SAP_BR_EDOCUMENT_SPECIALIST_PC).  \n   \u2022 Monitor with \u201cManage Electronic Documents\u201d and Integration Suite\u2019s Message Monitor.\n\nPlain-language summary  \nCreate a new electronic document process in Public Cloud by writing a released ABAP handler class, plugging it into the framework via the provided BAdIs, registering the process, type, and interface in the Fiori \u201cManage eDocument \u2026\u201d apps, and then testing it end-to-end through the cockpit and Integration Suite.\n\nMini-snippet (BAdI EDOCUMENT_BASE_EXT)\n\nMETHOD if_badi_interface~execute.\n  PROCESS = 'ZPROC_FIINV_EXT'.\n  HANDLER_CLASS = 'ZCL_EDOC_FIINV_HANDLER'.\nENDMETHOD.\n\nMini-snippet (call to generic sender inside handler)\n\ncl_edocument_ext_es=>process_req_send_global(\n  EXPORTING\n    it_edocument   = lt_edoc_hdr\n    iv_interface   = 'WS_ZFIINV_01'\n    iv_process     = 'ZPROC_FIINV_EXT'\n    iv_submit_mode = cl_edocument_ext_es=>gc_submit_direct ).\n\nThese condensed steps follow SAP\u2019s officially released guidance (see SAP Help \u201cElectronic Document Processing Framework \u2013 Developer Extensibility\u201d and the tool outputs above), ensuring an upgrade-safe custom process in the S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition environment.",

    "generated_answer": "Technical explanation  \n\u2022 In SAP S/4HANA Cloud, public edition (the platform on which DRC runs), customers are not allowed to create their own ABAP Dictionary tables with SE11 or any classic development tool.  \n\u2022 The permitted way to persist custom data is the Fiori app \u201cCustom Business Objects (CBO)\u201d.  \n  \u2013 When you publish a CBO, the system generates a persistent table named /BOBF/<hash>.  \n  \u2013 That generated table appears in the value help of the \u201cDatabase Tables/Views\u201d field when you define a DRC (Statutory Reporting) Query.  \n\u2022 Therefore, for a new-country process you:  \n  1. Model the required fields in a Custom Business Object and publish it (optionally enable \u201cService Generation\u201d or \u201cReporting\u201d).  \n  2. Open Define Statutory Reports \u2192 Queries \u2192 Add Query and choose Data Source Type = Database Tables/Views.  \n  3. Select the generated /BOBF/\u2026 table as the Data Source Name and continue with the usual parameter/filter mapping.  \n\u2022 No other DB artefact types (custom CDS views, HANA CalcViews, direct ABAP tables) can be created in the public-cloud tenant, and none are needed\u2014the CBO table fully meets DRC data-source requirements.\n\nPlain-language takeaway  \nYou cannot create an ABAP table yourself in Public Cloud; instead you create a Custom Business Object, and the system builds an internal table that DRC can use.\n\nMini example  \n1. App \u201cCustom Business Objects\u201d \u2192 Create  \n   \u2022 ID: ZCNTRY_SAF_TAX  \n   \u2022 Fields: COUNTRY (key), TAX_CODE, TEXT  \n   \u2022 Publish  \n2. DRC \u2192 Define Statutory Reports \u2192 Queries \u2192 Add  \n   \u2022 Data Source Type: Database Tables/Views  \n   \u2022 Data Source Name: /BOBF/ZZZZZZZZZZ (generated by step 1)  \n3.

Always declare the UUID field exactly as `EDOC_UUID` or `SYSUUID_C32`; never shorten it.  \n2. Keep the table type #REGULAR; in Public Cloud you cannot use pooled/cluster tables.  \n3. Avoid direct foreign-key relationships to SD/FI tables; use domains only (cloud extensibility rule).  \n4. After transport, register the table in Fiori app \u201cManage eDocument Type\u201d \u2192 Tab \u201cExtension Tables\u201d; the framework will then automatically fill and delete the table via BAdI `EDOCUMENT_BASE_EXT`.  \n5. Implement interface `IF_EDOCUMENT_EXT_*` (usually methods `PROCESS_CREATE`, `DELETE_FROM_DB`, \u2026) in your country handler class to read/write the table.\n\nPlain-language summary  \nCreate a normal ABAP Cloud table with MANDT + EDOC_GUID as keys and any additional fields you need; the DRC framework will populate it once you link the table to the eDocument type in configuration.",

In SAP S/4HANA Cloud, public edition, you can ship an ABAP class that participates in Document & Reporting Compliance (DRC) \u201cprocess mapping\u201d by using the Developer-Extensibility BAdIs delivered in the electronic-document framework.  \nThe key vehicle is enhancement spot ES_EDOCUMENT_CLOUD and its BAdIs\u2014for mapping tasks the most relevant is EDOC_ADAPTOR_CLOUD. When you create an enhancement implementation in ADT (Eclipse-based ABAP Development Tools), the wizard generates an ABAP class that implements the released interface. Inside that class you may\n\n\u2022 decide whether an eDocument is created (method IS_RELEVANT)  \n\u2022 alter or append XML segments that the framework/AIF will later transmit  \n\u2022 fill or modify custom fields (used together with EDOC_CUSTOM_FIELDS_* BAdIs)  \n\nPrerequisites and limits (from SAP Help & DRC extensibility FAQ)  \n\u2022 Public-cloud system must run in the 3-system DEV/Q/P landscape so that Developer Extensibility is enabled.  \n\u2022 Your user needs role SAP_BR_DEVELOPER.  \n\u2022 Only released objects and APIs may be used; runtime blocks unreleased ones.  \n\u2022 You adapt the standard mapping; creating an entirely new mapping runtime in ABAP is not supported\u2014use DMEE-EX or AIF objects plus the above BAdIs.  \n\u2022 No classic SE18/SE19; all work is done in ADT.  \n\nQuick implementation outline  \n1.

ADT generates class ZCL_EDOC_ADAPT_IN_GSTR (example).  \n4. In the method CHANGE_XML: read importing structure, change CHANGING xml_table, activate.  \n5.

Country/region handler class  \n   Method IF_EDOCUMENT_BASE_EXT~DETERMINE_EDOCUMENT_CLASS  \n   \u2192 export CV_EDOC_CLASS_NAME = name of your subclass of CL_EDOCUMENT_EXT_ES (e.g. \u2018ZCL_EDOC_US\u2019).\n\n2. eDocument process name and version  \n   Method IF_EDOCUMENT_BASE_EXT~DETERMINE_PROCESS  \n   \u2192 export  \n      CV_PROCESS_NAME    = process you modelled in \u201cManage eDocument Process\u201d (e.g. \u2018Z_E_INVOICE\u2019)  \n      CV_PROCESS_VERSION = \u20180001\u2019 (or other version).\n\nOnly when both values are returned does the framework generate the eDocument header/item records and hand control to your country handler.  \n\nCall sequence & constraints  \n\u2022 All active implementations are executed sequentially; the result of the LAST one is taken.  \n\u2022 Because CL_EDOC_FACTORY_EXT can generate only a single eDocument instance, you must ensure only one active implementation per (filter) country/region.  \n\nConfiguration steps in brief  \n1.

    "generated_answer": "Technical explanation (based on the two SAP-Help excerpts above)\n\n1. What an \u201ceDocument Type\u201d is  \n   \u2022 It is the key customizing object (table EDOCC_DOC_TYPE) that represents one legal/compliance process in Document & Reporting Compliance (DRC).  \n   \u2022 The type stores the runtime parameters of that process \u2013 country/region, submission scenario, XML mapping variant, communication channel, AIF interface, validation rules, etc.  \n   \u2022 Cockpit apps (EDOC_COCKPIT / Manage Electronic Documents) read this value to select the right monitoring layout and follow-up actions.\n\n2. Why you must create it for every new process you build with DRC extensibility  \n   \u2022 Unique process identifier \u2013 The system needs a new code to distinguish your custom process from SAP-delivered ones (sap_documentation_summary [1]).  \n   \u2022 Trigger logic \u2013 You map the eDocument Type to source document categories (FI, SD, MM-IV, Delivery, Settlement\u2026) via SSCUIs \u201cAssign eDocument Type to \u2026\u201d. Only after the mapping exists will the posting of those documents automatically create an eDocument (sap_help_lookup \u00a72b).  \n   \u2022 Parameter container \u2013 All other extensibility artefacts (value mappings, cloud communication flag, number ranges, multiple-instance factory class, etc.) are stored per eDocument Type (sap_help_lookup \u00a73).  \n   \u2022 Multi-process flexibility \u2013 A single country/source-document combination can legally require several electronic documents (e.g. invoice vs. credit note vs. transport registration). Separate eDocument Types let you keep those flows apart and run them in parallel (sap_documentation_summary [1]).  \n   \u2022 Monitoring & analytics \u2013 Filters, job scheduling variants and status values in the cockpit use the eDocument Type field; without it you cannot monitor or resend the new process correctly.\n\n3. How it is created in SAP S/4HANA Cloud, public edition  \n   Role needed: SAP_BR_BPC_EXPERT.  \n   a. Activate the source document for your company code.  \n   b. Run the relevant \u201cAssign eDocument Type to \u2026\u201d SSCUI and enter a new eDocument Type code (e.g. Z_AR_INV).  \n   c. Optionally maintain \u201cDefine Process Communication Through Cloud Services\u201d and value-mapping SSCUIs.  \n   (All steps are listed under sap_help_lookup \u00a72 and \u00a73.)\n\nShort example  \n\u2022 You need to send Peppol order responses from SD credit-memo billing documents.  \n  \u2013 Create eDocument Type Z_PEPO_SDOR (Process: PEPPOL_ORDER_RESPONSE).  \n  \u2013 Map SD billing document type CR to Z_PEPO_SDOR in SSCUI \u201cAssign eDocument Type to Billing Document Type\u201d.  \n  \u2013 Maintain XML field mapping and communication arrangement.  \n  Result: when a CR document is posted, DRC generates an electronic \u201cOrder Response\u201d that appears in the cockpit under type Z_PEPO_SDOR.\n\nPlain-language takeaway  \nYou create an eDocument Type because it is the \u201cname tag\u201d that links your source documents to all the metadata, mapping rules, and monitoring needed for a new electronic-document process; without that tag the system cannot recognise, create, or track the new compliance flow.",

It aligns well with both the expert answer and the additional context provided by the tool. Here's why:\n\n1. Correct BAdI Identification: The answer correctly identifies that the XML enrichment happens in the XML-filling BAdI (IF_EDOC_EU_XML_INVOICE~FILL_XML_FILE for invoices), which is more precise than the expert answer's mention of EDOC_ADAPTOR.\n\n2. Detailed Implementation: It provides a step-by-step explanation of the implementation process, including where to find the BAdI (SE18/SE19 or Fiori \"Custom Logic\" app) and the runtime sequence.\n\n3. Code Example: The answer includes a detailed coding pattern example for Peppol UBL 3.0, which is more specific and helpful than the expert answer.\n\n4. Comprehensive Coverage: It covers multiple aspects such as handling multiple files, size limits, alternatives for large files, and activation/testing procedures.\n\n5. Technical Accuracy: The answer correctly explains how to embed files using Base64 encoding and the relevant XML structure (AdditionalDocumentReference).\n\n6. Alignment with Tool Context: The information provided aligns well with the tool's output, which mentions using BAdI methods to add attachments to the standard XML.\n\n7.

    "generated_answer": "Technical explanation  \n\u2022 In S/4HANA Cloud, private-edition the list of buttons that appear in the eDocument Cockpit (Submit, Cancel, Get Status, \u2026) is hard-coded by SAP in table EDOC_ACTIONS and the framework class CL_EDOC_ACTION_FACTORY.  \n\u2022 SAP has released several in-app BAdIs (visible in the \u201cCustom Logic\u201d Fiori app) for eDocument processes, but none of them expose EDOC_ACTIONS or allow you to register a new cockpit action. The officially released BAdIs are limited to:  \n  \u2013 deciding whether an eDocument must be created,  \n  \u2013 enriching/validating the XML before \u201cSubmit\u201d,  \n  \u2013 adding custom database/UI fields.  \n\u2022 Neither SE18/SE19 enhancement spots nor classic configuration views for EDOC_ACTIONS are delivered in the Cloud extensibility scope. Therefore you cannot:  \n  \u2013 create your own action code (e.g. Z_SUBMIT_TO_PORTAL),  \n  \u2013 add a new button to the cockpit toolbar,  \n  \u2013 change the sequence or visibility of standard actions by code.  \n\u2022 If you build a custom eDocument process (Z-process) you can only assign the standard action catalogue that SAP already delivers; the framework shows those actions automatically once the process has entries in EDOC_ACTIONS (SAP content transport).  \n\u2022 Work-arounds endorsed by SAP documentation:  \n  \u2013 Put your additional logic in an existing action (e.g. inside the BAdI \u201cCloud EDOC Adaptor: Modify Final XML\u201d that runs during SUBMIT).  \n  \u2013 Trigger the custom function outside the cockpit: a Fiori app or a background job calling the released OData service API_EDOCUMENT_SRV.  \n  \u2013 Raise an SAP Influence request / OSS incident if you need a \u201creleased\u201d BAdI for new actions.\n\nExample  \nWanted: \u201cArchive\u201d button in the cockpit for a bespoke clearance portal.  \nNot possible: No released API to add ARCHIVE to EDOC_ACTIONS.  \nFeasible alternative: Keep the standard SUBMIT button, implement BAdI CLD_EDOC_MODIFY_FINAL_XML to send the file to both the legal endpoint and your archive, or create a custom Fiori tile that calls API_EDOCUMENT_SRV/archive.\n\nPlain-language summary  \nIn SAP S/4HANA Cloud, private-edition you cannot add or change buttons (actions) in the eDocument Cockpit; you can only use SAP\u2019s standard actions and place any extra logic in the published BAdIs or a separate app.",

Persist and expose the field  \n   \u2022 Fiori app \u201cCustom Logic\u201d \u2192 Business Context \u201cDocument Compliance\u201d.  \n   \u2022 Implement BAdI \u201ceDocument Custom Fields\u201d (technical name: EDOCUMENT_CUSTOM_FIELDS).  \n     \u2013 Method APPEND_FIELDS: add your YY1_* field to ct_extension_fields so it is stored with every new eDocument.  \n   \u2022 Optional: Implement BAdI \u201ceDocument Custom Fields (UI)\u201d to make the column appear in the cockpit list/detail view (set label, position, tooltip in ct_ui_fields).\n\n3. Pass the field to the outbound XML (if required)  \n   \u2022 Implement BAdI \u201cCloud EDOC Adaptor BADI: Modify Final Invoice XML\u201d (/S4EDOC/CL_EAI_MODIFY_FINAL_INV).  \n     Example (excerpt):  \n     ```\n     DATA(lt_edoc) = edoc_data->get_header( ).\n     READ TABLE lt_edoc INTO DATA(ls_hdr) INDEX 1.\n     IF ls_hdr-yy1_shiptolocation IS NOT INITIAL.\n       xml->set_value(\n         exporting\n           xpath = '/Invoice/Shipment/ShipToID'\n           value = ls_hdr-yy1_shiptolocation ).\n     ENDIF.\n     ```\n\n4.

Preparation in ADT (ABAP Cloud)  \n   \u2022 Create an ABAP Cloud project in your 3-system landscape tenant.  \n   \u2022 Create a package Z_EDOC_<country> with \u201cABAP Cloud \u2013 Development\u201d profile.  \n   \u2022 Make sure you restrict your code to objects released for cloud (check \u201cOverview of Changes in Extensibility Objects\u201d, rel. 2502+).\n\n2. Create the Framework Basics (Fiori configuration)  \n   a. App \u201cManage eDocument Types\u201d \u2013 define a new type (e.g. ZINV).  \n   b. App \u201cManage eDocument Process\u201d \u2013 create a new process (e.g. ZPROC) and model the flow:  \n      \u2013 Start Step (Create from Source Document)  \n      \u2013 Processing Step (Submit to Web Service)  \n      \u2013 Optional extra steps: Send Mail, Delete/Cancellation, etc.\n\n3. (Optional) Persist Extra Data  \n   \u2022 If you need country-specific fields, create table /1EDOC/ZC_<country> in ADT.  \n   \u2022 Use domains/data elements delivered in interface IF_EDOC_EXT_DATATYPES.\n\n4. Create the Country/Region Handler Class  \n   \u2022 Class name example : ZCL_EDOC_CL_<country> (sub-class of CL_EDOCUMENT_EXT_ES or implement IF_EDOCUMENT_EXT_ES).  \n   \u2022 Mandatory methods to redefine/implement:  \n     \u2013 CREATE_DOCUMENT  \n     \u2013 SUBMIT_DOCUMENT  \u2192 call CL_EDOCUMENT_EXT_ES=>PROCESS_REQ_SEND_GLOBAL( \u2026 ).  \n     \u2013 CHECK_STATUS / SET_STATUS  \n     \u2013 (optional) DELETE_DOCUMENT, CANCEL_DOCUMENT\n\n5. Implement the Three Key BAdIs (Enhancement Spot ES_EDOCUMENT_EXT)  \n   a. EDOCUMENT_BASE_EXT  \n      \u2013 Filters: source billing type, country, etc.  \n      \u2013 Sets cv_process = \u2018ZPROC\u2019 and cv_handler_class = \u2018ZCL_EDOC_CL_<country>\u2019.  \n   b. EDOCUMENT_INT_CONN_EXT  \n      \u2013 Executes the outbound HTTP/SOAP call. Typical skeleton:  \n        METHOD if_edocument_int_conn_ext~execute.  \n          \"build XML / UBL payload  \n          CALL TRANSFORMATION zxslt_pep_pol \u2026  \n          DATA(lo_http) = cl_http_client=>create_by_destination( \u2018ECM_TXN_PORTAL\u2019 ).  \n          lo_http->send( ). lo_http->receive( ).  \n          \"fill ct_response[] for cockpit message update  \n        ENDMETHOD.  \n   c. (Optional) EDOCUMENT_MESSAGE_EXT \u2013 parse inbound confirmations.\n\n6. Communication Arrangement  \n   \u2022 Create Communication System & Arrangement exposing destination ECM_<SRV>.  \n   \u2022 Assign it in \u201cCommunication Arrangements\u201d so the HTTP client in step 5 uses the right destination.\n\n7. Complete Process Mapping  \n   \u2022 Return to \u201cManage eDocument Process\u201d and link:  \n     \u2013 Start Step \u2194 Handler CREATE_DOCUMENT  \n     \u2013 Processing Step \u2194 Handler SUBMIT_DOCUMENT (via INT_CONN BAdI)  \n     \u2013 Status mappings (Green, Yellow, Red) to response codes you write in SET_STATUS.\n\n8. Test & Monitor  \n   \u2022 Post a source document (e.g. SD billing).  \n   \u2022 Monitor in Fiori \u201cManage Electronic Documents\u201d (F5690).  \n   \u2022 Use cockpit filters to view log messages written by ADD_MESSAGE of CL_EDOCUMENT_EXT_ES.\n\n9. Optional Add-Ons  \n   \u2022 Implement Send e-mail step (class CL_EDOC_SEND_EMAIL).  \n   \u2022 Provide XSLT to display XML directly in the cockpit (\u201cDisplay XML\u201d step).  \n   \u2022 Add unit tests with Test Double Framework against IF_EDOCUMENT_EXT_ES.\n\nKey Objects at a Glance  \n\u2022 Framework class  CL_EDOCUMENT_EXT_ES (released)  \n\u2022 Interface        IF_EDOCUMENT_EXT_ES  \n\u2022 BAdIs            EDOCUMENT_BASE_EXT, EDOCUMENT_INT_CONN_EXT, EDOCUMENT_MESSAGE_EXT  \n\u2022 Apps             Manage eDocument Types, Manage eDocument Process, Communication Arrangements, Manage Electronic Documents  \n\u2022 Tables           EDOCUMENT, EDOC_PROCSS, optional /1EDOC/<country>\n\nPlain-language takeaway  \n\u201cCreate a new eDocument process in S/4HANA Cloud by defining the type and process in Fiori, coding one handler class plus two BAdIs (one to pick your handler, one to call the authority web service), wiring them up in \u2018Manage eDocument Process\u2019, and testing everything in the cockpit\u2014 all while sticking to released ABAP Cloud APIs.\u201d",

What changed with SAP Notes 3496530 / 3496562  \n   \u2022 Both notes tighten the BTE checks that decide whether an FI/MM document should trigger eDocument creation.  \n   \u2022 After they are in your system, the checks read ONLY the official DRC Customizing tables (EDOC_CC_ACT, EDOC_ACC_TYPE, EDOC_IV_TYPE \u2026).  \n   \u2022 If just one required entry is missing, the BTE returns \u201cNO _EDOC\u201d \u2013 the posting succeeds but nothing is written to EDOC_HEADER.\n\n2. Why your reposted credit note (MR8M \u279c subsequent credit) creates no eDoc  \n   a) The reversal you executed with MR8M uses a different FI document type (e.g. **\u2018MR\u2019** or **\u2018RM\u2019**).  \n   b) That document type is not mapped to the Malaysia credit-memo eDoc type **MY_CRE** in SSCUI 105639 \u201cAssign eDocument Type to Accounting Document Type\u201d.  \n      \u2192 the new runtime check introduced by 3496530 therefore blocks eDoc creation.  \n   c) A second frequent gap is that the company code was never activated for source category **ACC** or **IV** in SSCUI 105638 \u201cActivate Source Type Documents for Company Code\u201d.\n\n3.

Where DRC expects the number  \n   \u2022 In the standard Malaysia Import Invoice mapping the extractor class CL_EDOC_MY_IV_EXTRACTOR looks for the text object EKKO, text ID F01 (\u201cHeader Text\u201d) of the purchase-order header.  \n   \u2022 The constant used in the code is IMPORT_TEXT_TYPE = \u2018F01\u2019.  \n   \u2022 The content of this text is copied to XML element <CustomsFormReference>. The same rule is applied when the source document of the e-Document is a MIRO invoice.\n\n2. Why you receive \u201cspecial characters not allowed\u201d  \n   \u2022 The XML-schema delivered by IRBM for the tag <CustomsFormReference> allows only letters, digits and the hyphen (ASCII-minus).  \n   \u2022 Your custom logic currently picks up the complete MIGO header text; that text probably contains line breaks, \u201c/\u201d, \u201c,\u201d or other symbols that violate the schema.  \n   \u2022 Because no value was entered in the official field (PO-header text F01), the extractor still finds whatever is stored in EKKO-F01 (often a long free-text or even nothing) and fails the schema check.\n\n3.

What the cockpit really does  \n\u2022 When the PUSH service (DCPPUSHSERVICE) delivers the XML of the inbound invoice, SAP Document & Reporting Compliance stores it in table EDOC_XML.  \n\u2022 The cockpit does not read any PDF file that you attach to the SOAP message.  \n\u2022 If the user presses \u201cDisplay PDF\u201d, the system renders a PDF on-the-fly from the stored XML by calling class CL_EDOC_PDF_FACTORY (on-premise: FM EDOC_PDF_GENERATE) and the Adobe form that is assigned to the process.  \n\u2022 Therefore the button is hidden (or greyed out) until a form is assigned in Customizing.\n\n2. Why you currently see only \u201cDisplay HTML\u201d  \nNo Adobe form is assigned for the inbound scenario \u201cIncoming eInvoice\u201d (or the country-specific key). Without that entry the cockpit suppresses the PDF button and offers only HTML.\n\n3. How to make the PDF button appear  \nIMG / SSCUI path  \nCross-Application Components \u25ba SAP Document and Reporting Compliance \u25ba Output \u25ba Specify Output Forms for PDF Generation  \n\nCreate (or check) an entry for your inbound scenario, e.g.  \n\nDocument Type\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 IT_INCOMING (or DE_INCOMING, generic INCO, etc.)  \nForm Name\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 EDO_IT_INCO_INVOICE_CLOUD_V1  (you may copy it and use your own)  \nOutput Format\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 PDF  \n\nSave and transport.\n\n4. Result in the cockpit  \n\u2022 Open app \u201ceDocument Cockpit\u201d (or transaction EDOC_COCKPIT).  \n\u2022 Select an inbound document and choose Display \u2192 \u201cDisplay PDF\u201d.  \nThe system now generates and shows the PDF that corresponds to the original ZUGFeRD invoice; HTML and XML remain available as alternative views.\n\n5. Do you still need to send the PDF as an attachment?  \nNo. Once the form is configured, the cockpit renders a compliant PDF/A-3 containing the XML; the extra attachment you push with DCPPUSHSERVICE is ignored and only increases payload size.\n\nPlain-language summary  \nAdd an Adobe form for the inbound invoice process in \u201cSpecify Output Forms for PDF Generation\u201d; afterwards a \u201cDisplay PDF\u201d button appears in the eDocument Cockpit and shows the original ZUGFeRD invoice\u2014there\u2019s no need to attach the PDF in the PUSH message.",

    "generated_answer": "Technical explanation  \n1. Which certificate is required?  \n  \u2022 It is NOT a certificate that you create locally.  \n  \u2022 It is the SSL-client (public) certificate that belongs to the service instance \u201cDocument and Reporting Compliance, cloud edition \u2013 Peppol Exchange\u201d that you subscribed to in SAP BTP.  \n  \u2022 This certificate allows S/4HANA Cloud to authenticate itself when it calls the Peppol Exchange service; therefore it must be stored on the S/4HANA side in the Communication User record and referenced in the related Communication System (SAP_COM_0529).  \n\n2. Where do I download it?  \n  a. In the SAP BTP cockpit go to the sub-account where the Peppol Exchange subscription was made.  \n  b. Navigate to:  \n      \u2022 Instances and Subscriptions \u2192 choose your instance of \u201csap-peppol-exchange\u201d (or similarly named)  \n      \u2022 Create or open an existing Service Key (button \u201cCreate Service Key\u201d).  \n  c.

Download / copy that certificate and save it locally:  \n      \u2022 If it is a *.p12 file, export the public part as X.509 Base-64.  \n      \u2022 If it is already a *.pem, simply rename the file extension to *.cert (or *.cer) for upload convenience.  \n\n3. Required format in S/4HANA Cloud  \n  \u2022 File type: X.509 certificate, Base-64 encoded (text file beginning with \u201c-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----\u201d).  \n  \u2022 Size: only the public key is needed; no private key must be imported into S/4HANA Cloud.  \n\n4.

    "generated_answer": "Technical explanation  \n\u2022 In SAP Document and Reporting Compliance the Peppol \u201cparticipant-ID\u201d is defined by the key pair  \n  Party-ID Type (e.g. VAT) + Party-ID Number (the actual VAT number).  \n\u2022 The customizing tables that store the assignment to a company code (EDOC_PEPPOL_CPTY / EDOC_PEPPOL_CVAT) have this key as UNIQUE.  \n\u2022 Therefore the same VAT number can be saved only once in the entire client, regardless of how many back-end systems or destinations you connect.  \n\u2022 When you attempt to create the same record a second time (e.g. for the IS-U client after already creating it for S/4HANA) the framework throws \u201cParticipant ID already assigned \u2026\u201d or similar.  \n\u2022 SAP\u2019s design assumption: one legal entity \u21d4 one Peppol participant \u21d4 one unique VAT ID; routing to the proper end-point is handled at communication level, not by duplicating the participant.\n\nWhat you can do\n\n1. Keep a single participant-ID (same VAT number) and differentiate only in the communication arrangement  \n   \u2013 In each client create one \u201cSettings for Communication\u201d entry that points to the correct access-point URL/certificate for that client.  \n   \u2013 The participant master data is shared; the runtime destination is what changes.  \n   \u2013 No duplicate VAT number is required, no error occurs.\n\n2. If you must have two Peppol registrations for the same company (rare legal/operational cases)  \n   a. Register a second Party-ID type (e.g. GLN, Leitweg-ID) for the same VAT-registered company.  \n   b. Maintain this second ID in SPRO activity \u201cAssign Party-ID Types to Companies\u201d.  \n   c. Use BAdI EDOC_PEPPOL_PARTY_ID to decide at run time which ID (VAT or GLN) is written into the outbound XML, based on source system or document type.\n\n3. Last-resort workaround (not recommended by SAP)  \n   \u2013 Create two separate legal entities (distinct company codes with different VAT numbers) and map them 1:1 to the two systems.  \n   \u2013 Only viable when you can legally operate with two VAT registrations.\n\nConfiguration objects to check / adjust  \n\u2022 SPRO \u2192 SAP Document and Reporting Compliance \u2192 eDocument \u2192 Peppol Exchange  \n  \u2013 \u201cAssign Party-ID Types to Companies\u201d (table EDOC_PEPPOL_CPTY)  \n  \u2013 \u201cMaintain VAT Number for Company Code\u201d (T001-STCEG)  \n\u2022 Fiori app \u201cSettings for Communication\u201d \u2013 one entry per system/client.  \n\u2022 Optional: BAdI EDOC_PEPPOL_PARTY_ID for dynamic ID selection.\n\nPlain-language summary  \nYou cannot store the same VAT number twice because SAP treats a \u201cVAT participant-ID\u201d as globally unique. Keep one VAT participant and use different communication settings for each client, or\u2014if you really need two registered IDs\u2014register a second identifier type (e.g. GLN) and switch IDs in a BAdI.",

    "generated_answer": "I\u2019m sorry, but I can\u2019t share the copyrighted ABAP source code of method CL_EDOCUMENT_FR_INV=>IS_RELEVANT.  \n\nBelow is a high-level, code-free explanation of how SAP delivers the enablement and what you need to adjust.\n\nTechnical overview (no proprietary code)\n\u2022 Source-type switch-in: SAP adds a new WHEN branch in IS_RELEVANT for source type \u201cSettlement Management Documents\u201d (S/4HANA table EDOSOURCE = \u2018SETM\u2019).  \n\u2022 Document-type filtering: Inside that branch the system evaluates the Settlement Management header table (WB2_VBRK / /SLOI/INV_HDR) to pick only \u201cinvoice-like\u201d document categories (e.g. condition contract settlement INV, CNF).  \n\u2022 Company-code check: Same routine as for FI invoices \u2013 calls CL_EDOCUMENT_FR_INV=>IS_CCODE_RELEVANT( ) to ensure the company code is in scope (EDO_CCTRIG / EDOCOMPANY).  \n\u2022 eDocument creation trigger: If all checks pass, method raises CQ_YN_RELEVANT = abap_true, which tells EDOC_CREATE_MANAGER to generate the FR eDocument and start mapping via class CL_EDOCUMENT_FR_IMP.  \n\u2022 Mapping enhancement: In mapping class CL_EDOCUMENT_FR_INV_MAP, SAP appends fields that exist only on Settlement Management docs (e.g. rebate agreement number, settlement calendar, WB2_VBRK-KNUMV). The data is copied into UBL <AllowanceCharge> or <Settlement> extension nodes.\n\nHow to extend or adapt\n1. In a customer subclass (ZCL_EDOCUMENT_FR_INV) redefine IF_EDOCUMENT_RELEVANCE~IS_RELEVANT.  \n2. Copy the standard logic but insert your additional conditions for SETM, e.g. specific contract types or settlement reason codes.  \n3. Do NOT modify SAP-delivered class. Instead, assign your subclass in IMG: Financial Accounting \u2192 SAP Document and Reporting Compliance \u2192 Country/Region-Specific Settings \u2192 France \u2192 BAdI: Determine Relevance.  \n4. To enrich mapping, implement BAdI EDOCUMENT_FR_MAPPING or enhance the extension include structure CI_EDOC_FR_INV_EXT and adjust your XSLT if you added custom XML nodes.\n\nPlain-language summary\nYou can\u2019t view the SAP code here, but the relevance check is basically an extra WHEN branch that tests for source type \u2018SETM\u2019, validates company code and document category, then flags the document as relevant so that the standard creation and mapping classes take over. To adapt it, create a BAdI implementation or subclass and insert your own filters and mapping logic.",

After the header text is fetched with READ_TEXT the routine concatenates all lines and extracts the four legal codes with a simple regular expression.  \n4. Each hit is appended to the exporting table ET_CODES and consumed later by the XML mapping class, enabling the same PKVK/POIN/PRID/FRCS behaviour for Settlement Management as for FI/SD.\n\nPlain-language summary  \nCopy the standard method, add a new CASE branch for Settlement Management that reads the WBRK header text, scan it for PKVK/POIN/PRID/FRCS and return them\u2014then France B2B processing will accept Settlement Management documents as a valid source type.",

Correct class identification: The answer correctly identifies CL_EDOC_MAP_FR_B2B_SD as the proper class for the new mapping class to inherit from, which matches the expert answer exactly.\n\n2. Detailed explanation: The answer provides a comprehensive technical explanation of why CL_EDOC_MAP_FR_B2B_SD is suitable for inheritance, including its existing functionality (header- and item-level data extraction, common Peppol-/UBL-specific field fills, tax and party mapping, value-mapping helper methods, and generic error handling).\n\n3. Code reduction emphasis: The answer explicitly addresses the question's concern about reducing duplicate coding by explaining how inheriting from CL_EDOC_MAP_FR_B2B_SD allows reuse of existing logic.\n\n4. Implementation guidance: The answer includes a code skeleton showing how to create the new class (zcl_edoc_map_fr_b2b_stlmt) inheriting from cl_edoc_map_fr_b2b_sd, and lists methods that may need to be redefined.\n\n5. Customizing instructions: The answer provides additional information on how to register the new subclass in the system, which is crucial for implementation.\n\n6. Alignment with tool-provided context: The inheritance structure described in the answer aligns with the information provided by the sap_documentation_summary tool, which confirms the hierarchical structure of mapping classes for different eInvoice processes.\n\nThe generated answer goes beyond the expert answer by providing more detailed explanations, implementation guidance, and a code skeleton, making it exceptionally helpful for addressing the user's question.",

Here's why:\n\n1. Correct Information:\n   - The answer correctly identifies that SAP delivers complete France B2B (Factur-X) mapping for classical FI and SD source types.\n   - It accurately mentions the mapping classes CL_EDOC_MAP_FR_B2B_FI for Accounting Document (FI) and CL_EDOC_MAP_FR_B2B_SD for SD Billing Document (SD).\n   - The answer correctly states that SAP has not shipped a mapping class for settlement-management billing (source type STLM).\n\n2. Partial Misalignment:\n   - The question specifically asks about finding a class that is \"already doing mapping for another source type but not settlement management documents.\" The answer doesn't directly address this specific point.\n   - While the answer provides information about existing mappings and the lack of STLM support, it doesn't explicitly identify a class that fits the criteria mentioned in the question.\n\n3. Additional Information:\n   - The answer provides extra information about how to handle STLM support, which wasn't explicitly asked for but could be useful context.\n\n4.

Here's the reasoning:\n\n1. Correct approach: The generated answer correctly identifies that the FILL_DELIVERY method needs to be redefined and enhanced. It also provides a detailed explanation of how to implement this using extension classes, which aligns with SAP's recommended approach.\n\n2. Code examples: The answer includes illustrative ABAP code snippets that demonstrate how to create source-extension and process-extension classes. This is helpful and goes beyond the expert answer in terms of implementation details.\n\n3. Explanation of the process: The answer provides a clear explanation of how the extension classes work together to achieve the desired result, including the IMG activities required to register the new classes.\n\n4. Alignment with tool results: The abap_method_codebase_search tool returned several implementations of the FILL_DELIVERY method, including one for the France B2B settlement management scenario (cl_edoc_map_fr_b2b_stlmt). The generated answer's approach aligns with these implementations, especially in clearing the delivery data for settlement management documents.\n\n5. Discrepancies with expert answer: While the generated answer provides a more comprehensive solution, it differs from the expert answer in the implementation details.

Class structure: The generated answer creates a new subclass (zcl_edoc_fr_fill) inheriting from cl_edoc_fr_fill, while the expert answer and context show implementations directly in classes like cl_edoc_map_fr_b2b_stlmt.\n\n2. Method signature: The generated answer uses different input and output parameters compared to the expert answer and context implementations.\n\n3. Implementation details: While both the generated answer and the expert answer read from the WBRK table, they process the data differently. The generated answer creates a more business-friendly text, while the expert answer focuses on reading and appending text directly from the document.\n\n4. Error handling: The generated answer includes more robust error handling and fallback mechanisms, which are not present in the expert answer.\n\n5. Language handling: The generated answer uses sy-langu for language determination, while some context implementations show explicit handling of different languages (e.g., 'A' and 'E').\n\nThe generated answer does demonstrate a good understanding of the requirement and provides a working solution. However, it may not align perfectly with the existing system architecture and conventions as shown in the context. It offers some improvements and additional features that could be beneficial but might require more integration effort.\n\nOverall, while the generated answer is technically sound and could be useful, it is not a direct match to the expert answer or the existing implementations in the context, hence the \"Partially Helpful\" rating.",
