    "answer": "To attach additional files to the standard XML in Public Cloud, you can use the Business Add-In (BAdI) EDOC_ADAPTOR_CLOUD and enhance the XML file generated for an electronic document.\nBy enhancing the XML file, you can include additional information that may be relevant for your business processes .\nTo implement this enhancement, you can follow these steps in ABAP Development Tools (ADT):\n1. In your ABAP project, go to the enhancement spot ES_EDOCUMENT_CLOUD and select 'New BAdI Enhancement Implementation'.\n2. Enter a package, name, and description for the implementation.\n3. Choose 'Add BAdI Implementation' and select EDOC_ADAPTOR_CLOUD .\n4. (Optional) Create a BAdI filter for Country and/or Generic Filter.\n5. Choose 'Implementing Class' to create a new implementation class.\n6. Activate your BAdI implementation .\nOnce you have implemented the BAdI, you can fill the XML tag <BuyersItemIdentification> with the desired additional information.\nThis can be done by reading the relevant data from the source documents and filling the appropriate XML tags.\nPlease note that the specific implementation details may vary depending on your system setup and requirements.\nIt is recommended to refer to the provided sources for more detailed instructions and examples.",

    "generated_answer": "Technical explanation  \n1. Use enhancement spot EDOC_ADAPTOR_CLOUD (Public-Cloud replacement of classic EDOC_ADAPTOR).  \n2. Implement method SET_OUTPUT_DATA.  \n   \u2022 The method delivers the generated XML of the electronic document in parameter IO_OUTPUT.  \n   \u2022 Table parameter ATTACHMENTS is provided to add, replace, or delete additional files.  \n3. Inside your implementation:  \n   a. Read the binary/content of the file you want to attach (for example from the Attachment List of the source billing document via CL_BDS_DOCUMENT_SET, CL_CMIS_DOCUMENT, or RAP attachment APIs).  \n   b. Append a new line to ATTACHMENTS and fill:  \n      \u2013 ATTACHMENT_TYPE   (e.g. \u2018XML\u2019, \u2018PDF\u2019, \u2018BIN\u2019)  \n      \u2013 SUBJECT           (file name shown in cockpit / e-mail)  \n      \u2013 SIZE              (bytes)  \n      \u2013 LANGUAGE          (optional)  \n      \u2013 IS_BINARY         (abap_true for binary, abap_false for plain text)  \n      \u2013 CONTENT           (xstring or string with the file payload)  \n4. Activate and transport your BAdI implementation. When the eDocument is created again, the extra file(s) are packed with the standard XML; the complete payload is sent to the government platform or, if you use the e-mail connector, attached to the customer e-mail.\n\nExample snippet (ABAP for Cloud):  \nMETHOD if_edoc_adaptor_cloud~set_output_data.  \n  DATA ls_attach TYPE edoc_s_attachment.  \n  \n  \"read attachment into lv_xcontent (xstring) \u2026  \n  \n  ls_attach-attachment_type = \u2018PDF\u2019.  \n  ls_attach-subject         = \u2018SupportingDoc.pdf\u2019.  \n  ls_attach-is_binary       = abap_true.  \n  ls_attach-size            = xstrlen( lv_xcontent ).  \n  ls_attach-content         = lv_xcontent.  \n  \n  append ls_attach to attachments.  \nENDMETHOD.\n\nAfter processing you can open the eDocument in app \u201ceDocument Cockpit\u201d \u2192 Display and you will see the extra file under \u201cAttachments\u201d.\n\nPlain-language summary  \nCreate a BAdI implementation of EDOC_ADAPTOR_CLOUD, and in its SET_OUTPUT_DATA method simply add your own file (PDF, XML, etc.) to the ATTACHMENTS table; the system automatically embeds it alongside the standard XML when the document is sent.",

Key-user extensibility (no coding)  \n   \u2022 App \u201cCustom Fields & Logic\u201d \u2013 add extra header/item fields to the billing or accounting document; the fields automatically flow into the XML if you map them in custom logic.  \n\n2. Developer extensibility (in a 3-system landscape)  \n   \u2022 BAdIs released for Document and Reporting Compliance, e.g. EDOC_IT_HEADER_ITEM_TEXT, let you post-process the XML after the standard mapping and fill or overwrite tags such as <Descrizione>, <Causale> or create additional <AltriDatiGestionali> blocks.  \n   \u2022 Implemented with the \u201cCustom Logic\u201d app; upgrade-safe.\n\n3. SAP Cloud Integration (CPI) iFlow copy  \n   \u2022 The delivered \u201cCloud Edition: Standard Integration\u201d iFlow that sends the XML to the SDI can be copied to your own namespace.  \n   \u2022 You insert customer-exit mapping steps or Groovy scripts to enrich or transform the payload before it is signed/posted.  \n   \u2022 Only the copy is touched, so upgrades do not overwrite your changes.\n\n4. Side-by-side apps on SAP BTP  \n   \u2022 Consume the public APIs/events for eDocuments to perform pre- or post-processing, add attachments, create analytics dashboards, etc.\n\nWhat you cannot do  \n\u2022 Modify SAP-delivered ABAP code or the original iFlow directly in the public-cloud tenant.  \n\u2022 Use unreleased objects; only released BAdIs, APIs and exit points are allowed.\n\nMini-snippet (BAdI skeleton)  \n```\nBAdI: EDOC_IT_HEADER_ITEM_TEXT  \nMETHOD if_edoc_it_header_item_text~change_xml.\n  LOOP AT ct_item INTO DATA(ls_item).\n    ls_item-descrizione = |Custom text { ls_item-matnr }|.\n    MODIFY ct_item FROM ls_item.\n  ENDLOOP.\nENDMETHOD.\n```\n\nPlain-language takeaway  \nYes\u2014you can adapt the Italian eInvoice process, but only through the officially released BAdIs, custom fields, copied CPI iFlows, or side-by-side apps; direct changes to SAP core objects are not allowed.",

Here's why:\n\n1. Accuracy: The generated answer correctly states that it is possible to extend actions in the eDocument Cockpit for custom-developed processes in S/4HANA Private Cloud. This aligns with both the expert answer and the information from the sap_documentation_summary tool.\n\n2. Completeness: The generated answer provides a detailed technical explanation of how to extend actions, including steps to create a custom class, configure it in the IMG, and assign it to statuses. This level of detail goes beyond what the expert answer provided and offers practical implementation guidance.\n\n3. Alignment with authoritative sources: While the generated answer's approach of creating a custom Z-class and registering it as a new action aligns with the general concept of extending functionality, it doesn't fully match the methods described in the sap_documentation_summary tool output. The tool mentions using Business Add-Ins (BAdIs) and the Custom Logic app for extending actions, which are not mentioned in the generated answer.\n\n4. Relevance to Private Cloud: The answer specifically addresses the question's context of Private Cloud, mentioning that full ABAP workbench access is available, which is relevant to the implementation method described.\n\n5. Limitations and restrictions: The generated answer provides useful information about UI limitations and restrictions, which adds valuable context not present in the expert answer.\n\nHowever, the answer falls short in a few areas:\n\n1. It doesn't mention the use of BAdIs or the Custom Logic app, which are highlighted in the sap_documentation_summary tool output as key methods for extending functionality.\n\n2. The answer doesn't discuss the option of using a function module for extending actions, which is mentioned in the expert answer as a method for triggering additional actions.\n\n3. The generated answer doesn't mention the Application Interface Framework (AIF) for logging and monitoring, which could be relevant for managing custom actions.\n\nIn conclusion, while the generated answer provides detailed and relevant information on extending actions in the eDocument Cockpit, it misses some key methods mentioned in the authoritative sources and the expert answer.

    "generated_answer": "Technical explanation  \n1. What SAP allows in S/4HANA Private Cloud  \n\u2022 All Electronic-Document Framework (EDO*) Customizing nodes are available in the private-cloud IMG.  \n\u2022 You have full ABAP workbench access, therefore you can create your own class that implements the framework interface IF_EDOCUMENT_ACTION_INT.  \n\u2022 SAP does not let you overwrite a delivered action (for example \u201cSUBMIT\u201d or \u201cGET_STATUS\u201d). The supported way is to register a new action (Z-action) and attach it to your own process or to a copy of an SAP process.  \n\n2. Steps to deliver the extension  \na. Create a Z-class that \u201cCLASS-inherits\u201d from the process-specific base class (for example CL_EDOCUMENT_RO, CL_EDOCUMENT_PE, \u2026) or implements IF_EDOCUMENT_ACTION_INT directly.  \n   \u2013 Mandatory methods: IF_EDOCUMENT_ACTION_INT~CHECK, ~EXECUTE, optionally ~GET_VARIANTS, ~AFTER_COMMIT, etc.  \nb. IMG \u2794 Cross-Application Components \u2794 General Application Functions \u2794 Electronic Document Framework  \n   \u25b8 Define Actions (table EDOACTION)  \n      \u2013 Create a new entry Z\u2026 and point it to your class.  \n      \u2013 Flag \u201cFrontend-Enabled\u201d if you want the button to appear in the cockpit.  \n   \u25b8 Assign Actions to Statuses (table EDOSTSACTN)  \n      \u2013 Add the Z-action to the status in which it should be offered in your custom process.  \nc. If you designed a brand-new process:  \n   \u25b8 Define Process (EDOPROC), then maintain the status flow and call the previous step.  \nd. Test in EDOC_COCKPIT / Fiori \u201ceDocument Cockpit\u201d. The framework will call your class when the user triggers the action.  \n\n3. UI limits you need to know  \n\u2022 The Fiori cockpit only renders the 12 generic buttons that SAP delivered (DISPLAY, SUBMIT, GET STATUS, USER1-USER10). Therefore your new backend action must be mapped to one of the \u201cUSERn\u201d function codes if you expect a visible button. Otherwise you trigger it from a background job or BAdI.  \n\u2022 Changing the label or icon of those generic buttons is possible via language-dependent text maintenance but not supported by SAP Standard.  \n\n4. Restrictions  \n\u2022 Do not alter SAP-delivered actions/classes; this is outside the modification contract.  \n\u2022 Keep the namespace Z* or Y* for customer objects.  \n\u2022 If you plan to ship the solution, also add the entries to transportable view-cluster V_EDO*.  \n\nPlain-language answer  \nYes \u2013 in S/4HANA Private Cloud you can build your own Z-action for a custom eDocument process: create an ABAP class that implements IF_EDOCUMENT_ACTION_INT, register it in IMG \u201cDefine Actions\u201d, and assign it to the required status; you may not change SAP\u2019s standard actions, but you are fully supported to add new ones.",

It covers all key points, including the use of Custom Fields and Logic apps, implementing specific BAdIs, displaying fields in Fiori apps, and the restrictions in the public cloud environment. The answer goes beyond the expert answer by providing step-by-step instructions, an example code snippet, and additional details about UI customization. The inclusion of both a technical explanation and a plain-language summary enhances its usefulness for different levels of expertise.",

In-app extensibility is supported \u2013 but only with the key-user tools \u201cCustom Fields and Logic\u201d and the predefined BAdIs that come with SAP Document and Reporting Compliance (DRC).  \n   \u2022 Create the field in app \u201cCustom Fields\u201d.  \n     \u2013 Business Context:  \n       \u2022 Electronic Document \u2013 Header (I_EDOCUMENTHDR) or  \n       \u2022 Electronic Document \u2013 Item  (I_EDOCUMENTITM)  \n     \u2013 Mark it \u201cOData\u201d and \u201cUI\u201d relevant.  \n   \u2022 Implement BAdI EDOC_CUSTOM_FIELDS_CLOUD (method FILL_EDOC_CUSTOM_FIELDS) in app \u201cCustom Logic\u201d.  \n     \u2013 Read the value from your source (billing doc, FI document, delivery, etc.).  \n     \u2013 Fill EXPORTING structure ES_EDOC_CUSTOM_FIELDS.\n\n2. Displaying the field in the Fiori apps  \n   \u2022 Manage Electronic Documents (list view) and the eDocument Cockpit automatically expose all custom fields that come from ES_EDOC_CUSTOM_FIELDS.  \n   \u2022 Use \u201cAdapt UI\u201d (classic key-user adaptation) or simply \u201cTable Settings \u25ba Columns\u201d inside the app to add the new column; no code change is needed.  \n\n3. Using the field in the outbound XML/Peppol/UBL file (optional)  \n   \u2022 Implement BAdI EDOC_XML_MODIFY_CLOUD if you also need the value in the generated XML.  \n   \u2022 Map CS_EDOC_XML_FILE-ADDITIONAL_DOCUMENT_REFERENCE or any other node to inject the custom field.\n\n4. Restrictions  \n   \u2022 You cannot enhance the underlying CDS views or database tables directly in public cloud.  \n   \u2022 No custom \u201cfreestyle\u201d UI extension is possible; only the key-user field exposure described above is allowed.  \n   \u2022 All logic must stay within the delivered BAdIs; enhancements in the ABAP stack outside these enhancement spots are not permitted.\n\nExample snippet (Custom Logic \u2013 BAdI implementation)\n\n```\nMETHOD if_edoc_custom_fields_cloud~fill_edoc_custom_fields.\n\n  DATA: ls_vbrk TYPE vbrk.\n\n  SELECT SINGLE * FROM vbrk\n    WHERE vbeln = is_edoc_source_data-billingdocument\n    INTO ls_vbrk.\n\n  es_edoc_custom_fields-z_myfield = ls_vbrk-zz_sales_channel.\n\nENDMETHOD.\n```\n\nAfter activation:\n1. Open \u201cManage Electronic Documents\u201d \u2192 Settings \u25ba Columns \u2192 tick \u201cZ_MYFIELD\u201d.\n2. The column appears in both Manage Electronic Documents and eDocument Cockpit screens.\n\nPlain-language answer\nYes\u2014within SAP S/4HANA Cloud you can add your own field to the Manage Electronic Documents/eDocument Cockpit apps by creating a custom field, filling it via the delivered BAdI EDOC_CUSTOM_FIELDS_CLOUD, and then adding the column through standard UI personalization; no classic code or database changes are required.",

Accuracy: The answer is mostly accurate and aligns with the expert answer and the tool-provided context. It correctly outlines the main steps of creating a custom field, implementing the BAdI, and coding the method.\n\n2. Completeness: The answer goes beyond the expert answer in providing detailed steps, which is commendable. It covers the creation of the custom field, implementation of custom logic, and even includes optional steps like exposing the field in the UI.\n\n3. Relevance: The answer is highly relevant to the question, addressing both the extension of the eDocument Process and the addition of a custom field using ADT.\n\n4. Areas for improvement:\n   a. The answer doesn't explicitly mention the prerequisite of having SAP S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition, which is stated in the expert answer.\n   b. While it mentions Developer Extensibility in the prerequisites, it doesn't emphasize its importance as much as the expert answer does.\n   c. The answer could benefit from a brief explanation of why certain steps are necessary, providing more context for the user.\n\n5. Additional value: The generated answer provides more detailed implementation steps and even includes a code example, which goes beyond the expert answer and adds significant value.\n\nOverall, the answer is very good and provides more detailed guidance than the expert answer.

    "generated_answer": "Technical step-by-step (Developer Extensibility with ADT)\n\n1. Prerequisites  \n   \u2022 You are in SAP S/4HANA Cloud, public edition with a Developer Extensibility space.  \n   \u2022 You have created an ABAP Cloud project in ABAP Development Tools (ADT).  \n   \u2022 User has role SAP_BR_DEVELOPER and access to the Custom Fields and Logic apps.\n\n2. Create the custom field first (key user step)  \n   a. Open app \u201cCustom Fields\u201d.  \n   b. Create \u2192 enter business context \u201cDocument Compliance \u2013 eDocument\u201d.  \n   c. Define field (e.g. ZZ_TOTAL_WEIGHT, type \u201cQuantity with Unit\u201d).  \n   d. Press Publish; wait until the transport and CDS views are generated.\n\n3. Find the enhancement spot in ADT  \n   \u2022 Package path: GLO-EDO \u2192 Enhancements \u2192 Enhancement Spots \u2192 ES_EDOCUMENT_CLOUD.  \n\n4. Create a BAdI implementation in ADT  \n   a. Right-click ES_EDOCUMENT_CLOUD \u2192 New \u2192 BAdI Enhancement Implementation.  \n   b. Choose enhancement BAdI EDOC_CUSTOM_FIELDS_CLOUD.  \n   c. Enter implementation name/package and save.  \n   d. Maintain a filter for the eDocument process (country, document type, etc.).\n\n5. Generate the implementing class  \n   \u2022 ADT proposes a class; accept.  \n   \u2022 The class automatically implements IF_EDOC_CUSTOM_FIELDS_CLOUD (method FILL_EDOC_CUSTOM_FIELDS).\n\n6. Code the method FILL_EDOC_CUSTOM_FIELDS  \n   Example (minimal):  \n   ```abap\n   METHOD if_edoc_custom_fields_cloud~fill_edoc_custom_fields.\n\n     DATA lv_total_weight TYPE /drc/cl_edoc_custflds_cloud=>ty_total_weight.\n\n     \"Read source fields \u2013 example from billing document\n     SELECT SINGLE ntgew INTO lv_total_weight\n       FROM vbrp\n       WHERE vbeln = is_billing_data-vbeln\n       AND   posnr = is_billing_data-posnr.\n\n     es_custom_fields-zz_total_weight = lv_total_weight.\n   ENDMETHOD.\n   ```\n   \u2022 `is_billing_data`, `is_accounting_data`, etc., are supplied by the framework; fill `es_custom_fields-*` with your value.  \n   \u2022 Activate class and implementation.\n\n7. (Optional) Expose field in the UI  \n   \u2022 Back in \u201cCustom Fields\u201d app, enable the new field for usage in \u201ceDocument Cockpit \u2013 Item\u201d and/or OData service and publish again.\n\n8. Test  \n   \u2022 Run app \u201ceDocument Cockpit\u201d (EDOC_COCKPIT).  \n   \u2022 Display an eDocument that matches the BAdI filter.  \n   \u2022 Column \u201cTotal Weight\u201d (or your label) now shows the value populated in step 6.\n\nOne-sentence summary  \nCreate the custom field via the Custom Fields app, then implement BAdI EDOC_CUSTOM_FIELDS_CLOUD in ADT (method FILL_EDOC_CUSTOM_FIELDS) inside enhancement spot ES_EDOCUMENT_CLOUD, populate the field in code, publish it for the cockpit, and the new field becomes part of the eDocument process.",

SAP Document and Reporting Compliance lets you add your own extension (custom) fields to an eDocument and then use those fields in an \u201cadditional authorization check\u201d so that only users who have the corresponding authorization value can see the document in Manage Electronic Documents or the legacy eDocument Cockpit.  \nKey points from SAP Help:\n\n1. Extend the eDocument object  \n   \u2022 Use the \u201cCustom Fields and Logic\u201d or \u201cKey User Extensibility\u201d tools to add a field (for example, Sales Org, Company Code, Profit Center, or any other organisational attribute) to the eDocument CDS view that feeds the cockpit UI.\n\n2. Fill the field automatically  \n   \u2022 In the BAdI EDOCUMENT_EXTENSION (or the cloud\u2010equivalent In-App Extension), copy the organisational value from the source document (billing/accounting) into the new field when the eDocument is created.\n\n3. Define the attribute for authorisation  \n   \u2022 IMG / Configure Additional Authorisation Check for eDocuments  \n   \u2022 Map the custom field to an authorisation object (for example, EDOC_ORG) and maintain individual values or ranges.\n\n4. Maintain roles  \n   \u2022 In PFCG (on-premise) or Maintain Business Roles (cloud), assign the authorisation object and values to the user role.  \n   \u2022 Users only see documents whose custom-field value matches the values in their role.\n\nExample snippet (pseudo-ABAP for on-premise BAdI implementation)\n\nMETHOD if_edocument_extension~fill_extension.\n  DATA(ls_ext) = io_extension->get_extension_data( ).\n  ls_ext-zz_sales_org = is_source_doc-vbeln_sales_org.\n  io_extension->set_extension_data( ls_ext ).\nENDMETHOD.\n\nAfter you activate the IMG activity \u201cEnable Additional Authorisation Check\u201d and add object Z_EDOC_SORG with field ZZ_SALES_ORG, the cockpit filter and list result will automatically hide any document whose Sales Org is not authorised for the user.\n\nPlain-language summary  \nYou can indeed hide or show eDocuments per user by creating a custom field (for example, Sales Organisation), filling it when the document is generated, and linking that field to an authorisation object.

Authorization object F_EDOC_ORG  \n   \u2013 Fields: EDOCORG (eDocument Organization) and ACTVT (01-Create, 02-Change, 03-Display, 06-Delete).  \n   \u2013 Class CL_EDOC_AUTHORITY_CHECK and the service layers of both apps call this object every time an eDocument is read.  \n2.

Define the values you want to protect (IMG \u2192 Financial Accounting \u2192 Localization \u2192 eDocument \u2192 Basic Settings \u2192 Define eDocument Organization).  \n   b. If the delivered mapping (one org = one company code) is not sufficient, implement the BAdI EDOC_ADAPTOR (method FILL_EDOCUMENT_ORG) to write any value you like into field EDOCORG of the eDocument header when it is created.  \n   c. Create or copy a PFCG role that contains object F_EDOC_ORG and maintain the permitted EDOCORG values plus the desired ACTVT activities.  \n   \u2013 In SAP S/4HANA Cloud you do this in Maintain Business Roles \u279d Restrictions tab \u279d \u201cElectronic Document: Restriction for Organizational Unit\u201d.  \n3. Result in the apps  \n   \u2013 Only documents whose EDOCORG value is contained in the user\u2019s role are returned by the CDS views used by the apps; everything else is invisible.  \n   \u2013 If EDOCORG is blank in a document, no check is executed (same principle as other SAP authorization objects).\n\nPlain-language takeaway\nCreate the organizational values you need, assign them to your eDocuments (optionally with a BAdI), and give users roles that hold those values\u2014then each user will only see the eDocuments you allow.",

Implement interface IF_EDOC_SOURCE_EXTENSION \u2192 method IS_RELEVANT.  \n     \u2013 Return abap_false when the source document (e.g. customer invoice, accounting document) must NOT get an eDocument.  \n     \u2013 This is the very first check; if it returns false, no entry is written to EDOC_HEADER and nothing appears in either app.  \n\n  2. (Optional) Implement interface IF_EDOC_SOURCE_PROCESS_EXT \u2192 method CHECK_RELEVANCE to add process-specific logic (e.g. only for process \u2018FIINV\u2019).  \n\n  3. If you need an even later \u201clast chance\u201d switch-off, create a BAdI implementation for EDOC_ADAPTOR_CLOUD and use method IS_RELEVANT (or CHECK_RELEVANCE if available) with the proper filter values (Country = DE, Generic_Filter = value you set in step 2).  \n\n\u2022 Because you are on Public Cloud:  \n  \u2013 Develop the classes in ADT; no SE19 access.  \n  \u2013 Register the classes in SSC-UI \u201cRegistering Handling Classes for Source Extension\u201d.  \n  \u2013 No modifications are needed in the standard apps; the framework simply never creates the record.  \n\nCode sketch (IS_RELEVANT in source-type exit)  \n```\nMETHOD if_edoc_source_extension~is_relevant.\n* Do not create eDocument for zero-amount invoices in company code 1710\n  IF is_src_header-bukrs = '1710'\n     AND is_src_header-net_value = 0.\n    r_is_relevant = abap_false.      \"suppress creation\n  ELSE.\n    r_is_relevant = abap_true.       \"standard behaviour\n  ENDIF.\nENDMETHOD.\n```\n\nResult  \n\u2022 When the posted document matches the suppression rule, no row is inserted into table EDOC_HEADER \u21d2 the document is absent in both apps.  \n\u2022 For all other documents, the framework proceeds and the eDocument is created normally.\n\nPlain-language takeaway  \nYes\u2014by using the whitelisted enhancement points (IS_RELEVANT exits or the EDOC_ADAPTOR_CLOUD BAdI) you can program rules so that an eDocument is only created when your own conditions are satisfied; otherwise it never shows up in Manage Electronic Documents or eDocument Cockpit.",

    "generated_answer": "Technical explanation\nIn SAP S/4HANA Cloud, public edition, you create a new electronic-document process in the Electronic Document Processing (EDP) framework by following SAP\u2019s \u201cdevelopment scenario.\u201d  The tasks, objects and extensibility points are delivered by SAP; you supply only the code or configuration that is marked \u201ccustomer.\u201d  The sequence is:\n\n1. Decide the trigger  \n   \u2022 Pick the business object (BKPF, VBRK, delivery, etc.) and the event (posting, release, reversal).  \n   \u2022 Implement BAdI EDOCUMENT_BASE_EXT to collect the source data and map it to the generic eDocument structure.\n\n2. Create the document instance  \n   \u2022 Call CL_EDOCUMENT_FACTORY=>CREATE (usually from your BAdI) to persist the header + item payload.  \n   \u2022 Result is status CREATED and the document appears in both Manage Electronic Documents and the eDocument Cockpit.\n\n3. Generate the outbound XML/JSON  \n   \u2022 Implement BAdI EDOCUMENT_XML_EXT (or country-specific successor) to build the exchange format (Peppol UBL, CFDI, etc.).  \n   \u2022 Use CL_EDOCUMENT_XML=>SAVE to attach the file to the document.\n\n4. Submit to the external service  \n   \u2022 Implement BAdI EDOCUMENT_INT_CONN_EXT to call SAP Document & Reporting Compliance, an external PEPPOL AP, a tax authority API, or your own middleware.  \n   \u2022 Update the document with technical response (Message ID, hash, QR code, etc.) and set status SENT / RECEIVED.\n\n5. Optional follow-up steps  \n   a) Send e-mail to business partner \u2192 reuse class CL_EDOC_EMAIL_UTILITY.  \n   b) Print or archive the legal PDF \u2192 call output management from EDOC step.  \n   c) Allow deletion only while status = CREATED (framework checks automatically).  \n   d) Restrict cancellation of the source document via BAdI EDOC_CANCEL_CTRL.\n\n6. User interaction & monitoring  \n   \u2022 Users review XML via \u201cDisplay XML\u201d link, restart failed transmissions, or cancel/resend.  \n   \u2022 All actions are logged in EDOCUMENT_H and EDOCUMENT_M tables.\n\n7. Transport & release  \n   \u2022 Transports are handled via Cloud Transport Management in the public cloud.  \n   \u2022 Activate the scenario in SSCUI 104564 \u201cEnable Custom eDocument Processes.\u201d\n\nPlain-language takeaway\nYou plug your own BAdI implementations into SAP\u2019s Electronic Document Processing framework: collect data, build the XML, call the external tax/PEPPOL service, and hand the response back\u2014everything else (storage, cockpit, monitoring) is already provided by SAP.\n\nMini example (simplified ABAP)  \n\n```abap\nMETHOD if_badi_edocument_base_ext~create_edocument.\n  DATA(ls_payload) = zcl_ddic_mapper=>from_bkpf( i_bkpf = is_bkpf ).\n  eo_edoc = cl_edocument_factory=>create( iv_doctype = 'ZPEPPOL' iv_payload = ls_payload ).\nENDMETHOD.\n\nMETHOD if_badi_edocument_xml_ext~get_xml.\n  ev_xml = zcl_peppol_serializer=>to_ubl( is_payload = is_edoc-payload ).\nENDMETHOD.\n\nMETHOD if_badi_edocument_int_conn_ext~submit.\n  DATA(lo_client) = zcl_peppol_client=>create( ).\n  lr_response = lo_client->send( iv_xml = iv_xml ).\n  es_return-code = lr_response->status.\n  es_return-message = lr_response->msg.\nENDMETHOD.\n```\n\nKey objects you will touch\n\u2022 BAdIs: EDOCUMENT_BASE_EXT, EDOCUMENT_XML_EXT, EDOCUMENT_INT_CONN_EXT  \n\u2022 Classes: CL_EDOCUMENT_FACTORY, CL_EDOCUMENT_XML, CL_EDOC_EMAIL_UTILITY  \n\u2022 Tables/Apps: EDOCUMENT_H/M, Manage Electronic Documents, eDocument Cockpit\n\nBy following the above seven steps you deliver a fully integrated, cloud-compliant electronic-document process without rebuilding cockpit, monitoring or persistence layers.",

Open app \u201cCustom Business Objects\u201d \u2192 Create  \n   \u2022 Object Name: YY1_CL_XX_DOCUMENTS  \n   \u2022 Structure: COUNTRY (key), DOC_ID (key), ADDITIONAL_INFO, STATUS  \n2.

    "agent_judge_reasoning": "The generated answer is partially helpful in addressing the question about developing an ABAP class for DRC Process mapping in Public Cloud using DRC extensibility features. Here's why:\n\n1. Correct information:\n   - The answer correctly states that it is possible to create an ABAP Cloud class for DRC process-level mapping in SAP S/4HANA Cloud, public edition.\n   - It accurately mentions the need for Developer Extensibility (3-system) option to be activated.\n   - The explanation of where the ABAP class fits (implementing IF_EDOC_PROCESS_MAPPER interface) and the typical methods (MAP_SOURCE_TO_EDOC and MAP_EDOC_TO_PROXY) are relevant and align with DRC extensibility concepts.\n\n2. Incomplete or potentially misleading information:\n   - The answer suggests that you can only create a brand-new end-to-end scenario or use specific BAdIs. However, the SAP documentation indicates that there are multiple extensibility options, including Key User Extensibility and Side-by-Side Extensibility, which are not mentioned.\n   - The answer doesn't fully explain the Integration Framework capabilities mentioned in the SAP documentation, which could be relevant for DRC process mapping.\n   - While the answer mentions ABAP Cloud rules and transport via gCTS, it doesn't provide details on the security and quality assurance aspects emphasized in the SAP documentation.\n\n3. Missing context:\n   - The answer doesn't discuss the different types of extensibility available in SAP S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition, which could provide a broader context for the user's question.\n   - It doesn't mention the possibility of creating custom fields in the eDocument Cockpit/Manage Electronic Documents Fiori App, which could be relevant for DRC process mapping.\n\n4. Alignment with ABAP code examples:\n   - The ABAP code examples provided by the tool don't directly correspond to the process mapping class described in the answer. While they show some DRC-related classes and methods, they don't explicitly demonstrate the implementation of IF_EDOC_PROCESS_MAPPER or the methods mentioned in the answer.\n\nIn conclusion, while the generated answer provides some correct and relevant information about developing an ABAP class for DRC Process mapping, it lacks some important details and context that could give a more comprehensive understanding of the extensibility features available in SAP S/4HANA Cloud, public edition. The answer is helpful to a degree but could be improved by incorporating more information from the SAP documentation and providing more accurate code examples.",

    "generated_answer": "Yes\u2014provided you are on SAP S/4HANA Cloud, public edition with the \u201cDeveloper Extensibility\u201d (3-system) option activated, you can build your own ABAP Cloud class to perform DRC (Document and Reporting Compliance) process-level mapping.\n\nTechnical explanation\n\n1. Scope prerequisites  \n   \u2022 System type: S/4HANA Cloud, public edition (3-system landscape).  \n   \u2022 Entitlements: \u2011 SAP Document and Reporting Compliance license  \n                 \u2011 SAP Integration Suite subscription (for the iFlow/runtime part)  \n   \u2022 Extensibility model: Developer Extensibility (ADT/ABAP Cloud).  \n   \u2022 You cannot alter SAP-delivered country scenarios; you can only  \n     \u2013 create a brand-new end-to-end scenario, or  \n     \u2013 plug in at the BAdI points SAP has released (e.g. EDOC_ADAPTOR_CLOUD).\n\n2. Where the ABAP class fits  \n   \u2022 For a new scenario you generate a \u201cDRC Extensibility Project\u201d in ADT  \n     \u2192 the template scaffolds an ABAP package containing an interface such as   \n       IF_EDOC_PROCESS_MAPPER.  \n   \u2022 You code a class (e.g. ZCL_EDOC_EXT_CL) that implements the interface or BAdI:  \n\n     CLASS zcl_edoc_ext_cl DEFINITION  \n       PUBLIC FINAL  \n       CREATE PUBLIC .  \n       PUBLIC SECTION.  \n         INTERFACES if_edoc_process_mapper.  \n       ...  \n\n   \u2022 Typical methods:  \n     \u2011 MAP_SOURCE_TO_EDOC() \u2013 read SD/FI document, fill EDOC* tables.  \n     \u2011 MAP_EDOC_TO_PROXY()   \u2013 build the outbound XML structure.  \n\n3. Usage constraints  \n   \u2022 ABAP Cloud rules apply: only whitelisted APIs and RAP business objects.  \n   \u2022 Transport between DEV/TEST/PROD via gCTS; no classic SE80, no modifications.  \n   \u2022 Delivered mapping classes remain locked; if you must tweak an SAP country flow, do it in CPI (iFlow) instead.  \n\n4. Alternative: small adaptations only  \n   \u2022 If your need is simply to decide whether an eDocument is relevant or to add custom fields, use BAdI EDOC_ADAPTOR_CLOUD in a developer-extensibility class\u2014no full process mapper required.\n\nPlain-language takeaway  \nIf your public-cloud tenant is enabled for Developer Extensibility, you are allowed to write a new ABAP Cloud class that maps your data into DRC\u2019s electronic-document structures; you just can\u2019t change SAP\u2019s own mapping code.",

They are implemented in ABAP Development Tools (ADT) and are all allow-listed for developer extensibility.\n\n1. EDOCUMENT_BASE_EXT  \n   \u2022 Is called during eDocument creation.  \n   \u2022 You return which Process ID, Process Version and eDocument handler class shall be used for the source document.  \n   \u2022 Mandatory \u2192 without it the framework cannot route the source-document to your new process.\n\n2. EDOC_ADAPTOR_CLOUD  \n   \u2022 Central adaptor BAdI for every custom process.  \n   \u2022 What you implement:  \n     \u2013 CHECK_RELEVANCE / CHECK_CANCELLATION (yes/no creation & cancellation rules)  \n     \u2013 MAP_XML_DATA (build or enrich the outbound XML/JSON payload)  \n     \u2013 AFTER_* methods (post-processing after create / submit / status)  \n   \u2022 Mandatory \u2192 it produces the payload that is handed over to the communication layer.\n\n3. EDOCUMENT_INT_CONN_EXT  \n   \u2022 Runs when the eDocument has to be sent (outbound).  \n   \u2022 You normally call CL_EDOCUMENT_EXT_ES\u2192PROCESS_REQ_SEND_GLOBAL inside your country handler; that in turn triggers this BAdI.  \n   \u2022 Here you connect to SAP Integration Suite, Peppol, local PI, or any HTTP/SFTP end-point.  \n   \u2022 Mandatory for every process that must leave the system (communication type \u201cCloud Service\u201d or \u201cLocal PI\u201d).\n\n4. EDOCUMENT_MESSAGE_EXT  \n   \u2022 Partner of the previous BAdI for inbound replies (status, responses, acknowledgements).  \n   \u2022 You parse the inbound message and update ES_STATUS / ET_LOG so the cockpit and Manage Electronic Documents app show the correct status.  \n   \u2022 Mandatory for every process with asynchronous inbound messages; still required even if your service returns \u201csynchronous\u201d HTTP 200/400 payloads because the framework calls it for parsing.\n\nOptional but frequently used BAdIs  \n\u2022 EDOC_CUSTOM_FIELDS_CLOUD\u2003\u2003persist & transport custom fields.  \n\u2022 EDOC_CUSTOM_FIELDS_UI_CLOUD\u2003display those fields in the cockpit / Manage Electronic Documents.  \n\u2022 IF_EDOC_DIALOG_HANDLER\u2003\u2003\u2003custom pop-ups or extra actions on the UI.  \n\u2022 Source-Extension interfaces (IF_EDOC_SOURCE_EXTENSION / IF_EDOC_SOURCE_PROCESS_EXT) \u2013 only if you first have to \u201cattach\u201d a source type that SAP has not linked to the process yet.\n\nMinimum implementation set for a brand-new process  \n\n   EDOCUMENT_BASE_EXT  \u2192 tells the framework which process to run  \n   EDOC_ADAPTOR_CLOUD  \u2192 builds the payload & governs relevance  \n   EDOCUMENT_INT_CONN_EXT \u2192 sends the payload  \n   EDOCUMENT_MESSAGE_EXT  \u2192 interprets replies  \n\nOnce these four BAdIs are active and filtered (Country + Generic_Filter) for your new Process ID, the standard cockpit (EDOC_COCKPIT app) and Fiori app \u201cManage Electronic Documents\u201d handle monitoring, mass jobs, error analysis and re-submission automatically.\n\nPlain-language summary  \nWhen you add an entirely new eDocument process in SAP S/4HANA Cloud, you must supply four enhancement \u201cplug-ins\u201d (BAdIs).

    "generated_answer": "Technical walkthrough  \n--------------------  \nBelow is a minimal but working template for a Public-Cloud implementation of BAdI EDOCUMENT_BASE_EXT.  \nThe code is 100 % Cloud-ready: it only uses released objects and keeps the footprint to the two interface methods that the framework calls.\n\n1. Create an enhancement implementation for enhancement spot `ES_EDOCUMENT_EXT`.  \n2. Inside it create a BAdI implementation of definition `EDOCUMENT_BASE_EXT`.  \n3. Maintain the filter value `COUNTRY = 'US'` (or any ISO code you need).  \n4. Use the class shown below as the implementing class.\n\n```abap\n\"======================================================================\n\"  Implementation class for BAdI EDOCUMENT_BASE_EXT\n\"  Package  : Z_EINVOICE_EXT (must be Cloud released)\n\"======================================================================\nCLASS zcl_edoc_us_base_ext\n  DEFINITION\n  PUBLIC\n  FINAL\n  CREATE PUBLIC .\n\n  PUBLIC SECTION.\n    INTERFACES if_edocument_base_ext.     \"<<\u2013 BAdI interface\nENDCLASS.\n\nCLASS zcl_edoc_us_base_ext IMPLEMENTATION.\n\n  \"---------------------------------------------------------------\n  \" Decide which eDocument handler class shall be instantiated\n  \"---------------------------------------------------------------\n  METHOD if_edocument_base_ext~determine_edocument_class.\n\n    \"Return your country-specific subclass of CL_EDOCUMENT_EXT_ES\n    \"This handler will later take care of mapping, signature, etc.\n    cv_edoc_class_name = 'ZCL_EDOC_US_EXT'.   \"<<\u2013 your handler class\n                                             \"   (cloud-released!)\n  ENDMETHOD.\n\n\n  \"---------------------------------------------------------------\n  \" Decide which eDocument process & version the framework uses\n  \"---------------------------------------------------------------\n  METHOD if_edocument_base_ext~determine_process.\n\n    \"Default values (blank = let standard decide)\n    CLEAR: cv_process_name, cv_process_version.\n\n    \"Very simple example: only SD invoices \u2192 electronic invoice V0001\n    IF is_edocument-source_type = 'SD_INVOICE'.\n      cv_process_name    = 'US_EINV'.  \"Process created in SSCUI\n      cv_process_version = '0001'.     \"Version also defined in SSCUI\n    ENDIF.\n\n  ENDMETHOD.\n\nENDCLASS.\n```\n\nOptional \u2013 sample handler class stub  \n------------------------------------\nTo avoid syntax errors during activation you can already create the referenced handler class (must inherit from the cloud-released helper class `CL_EDOCUMENT_EXT_ES`):\n\n```abap\nCLASS zcl_edoc_us_ext DEFINITION\n  PUBLIC\n  FINAL\n  CREATE PUBLIC\n  INHERITING FROM cl_edocument_ext_es.\n\n  PUBLIC SECTION.\n    \"Add your country-specific methods later\nENDCLASS.\n\nCLASS zcl_edoc_us_ext IMPLEMENTATION.\nENDCLASS.\n```\n\nHow it works at runtime  \n1. During source-document posting the framework invokes factory `CL_EDOC_FACTORY_EXT`.  \n2. The factory calls your BAdI implementation (filtered by COUNTRY = \u2018US\u2019).  \n3. `determine_edocument_class` returns `ZCL_EDOC_US_EXT` \u2013 the class that will actually build and send the XML.  \n4. `determine_process` returns the logical process & version so that the cockpit (app \u201cManage Electronic Documents\u201d) knows which customizing to apply.\n\nPlain-language summary  \nThis small ABAP class tells SAP S/4HANA Cloud which U.S. e-invoice handler class and which eDocument process/version to use whenever an SD invoice is posted.",

    "generated_answer": "Technical explanation\n\u2022 \u201ceDocument Type\u201d is the internal key that DRC (Document & Reporting Compliance, cloud edition) uses to represent one legal scenario or \u201cprocess\u201d (e-Invoice, e-Delivery Note, VAT report, etc.).  \n\u2022 When you create a new custom process through DRC extensibility you must tell the framework:  \n  \u2013 which runtime classes/factory will create the eDocument instance,  \n  \u2013 which BAdI implementations (custom logic, custom-field fill, UI extension) shall be executed,  \n  \u2013 which persistence tables (EDOC_HEADER / EDOC_ITEM) and CDS views the documents will be stored in.  \n  All three links are established via the field \u201cProcess (= eDocument Type)\u201d that you assign during configuration.\n\nWhy you cannot skip it\n1. Scoping of custom logic \u2013 In Key-user app \u201cCustom Logic\u201d you filter your BAdI implementation by Process. Without an eDocument Type the enhancement would run for every scenario, which is not allowed in Public Cloud.  \n2. Correct persistence \u2013 The framework looks up the eDocument Type to know which DDIC include (containing any custom fields) belongs to the document, and which factory class (e.g. CL_EDOC_FACTORY_EXT) should be called.  \n3. UI rendering \u2013 \u201ceDocument Cockpit\u201d (Fiori app F2541) uses the Process ID to fetch the right OData service schema so that list columns/object-page fields match your extensions.  \n4. Compliance separation \u2013 Each country\u2019s legal XML/JSON mapping as well as submission service is tied to exactly one eDocument Type. A new process therefore needs its own key to avoid mixing tax rules.\n\nMini example: creating an extra e-Invoice variant\n1. In SPRO activity \u201cDefine eDocument Types\u201d (or the Public-Cloud SSCUI) copy standard type AR_EINVOICE_CN \u2192 ZAR_EINV_EX.  \n2. Assign factory class CL_EDOC_FACTORY_EXT.  \n3. In F1481 \u201cCustom Fields\u201d add ZZ_WAREHOUSE to business context \u201cDocument Compliance\u201d; publish.  \n4. In F1482 \u201cCustom Logic\u201d create BAdI EDOC_CUSTOM_FIELDS_CLOUD, filter = ZAR_EINV_EX, and fill ZZ_WAREHOUSE.  \n5. Activate. Only documents of Process ZAR_EINV_EX will now carry and display the new field.\n\nPlain-language takeaway\nYou create an eDocument Type because it is the \u201cname tag\u201d that tells DRC which documents belong to your new scenario and ensures that only those documents run your custom code, store your extra fields, and follow the correct legal mapping.",

Licensing & landscape  \n   \u2022 Active license for SAP Document and Reporting Compliance.  \n   \u2022 Subscription to SAP Integration Suite (needed for message exchange once your new process goes live).  \n   \u2022 3-system landscape (DEV\u2013QAS\u2013PRD) if you plan to use Developer Extensibility (ADT). Key-user extensibility can remain in the 2-system Cloud landscape.\n\n3. Roles & authorisations for the key user / developer  \n   \u2022 Business catalog containing App F4306, e.g. SAP_CA_BC_EDO_PROC_MNG_PC.  \n   \u2022 Catalogs SAP_CORE_BC_EXT (Custom Fields & Logic) and SAP_UI_FLEX_KEY_USER (UI Adaptation).  \n   \u2022 If you intend to restrict the new process by organisational units, preparation of CDS-based access-control objects for those units.\n\n4. Scope activation  \n   \u2022 At least one DRC country/region scope item must be active in your system.  \n   \u2022 Verify in the \u201cAvailability & Dependencies\u201d matrix that the target country remains covered after every upgrade.\n\n5.

Find the correct enhancement spot\n\n\u2022 Open ADT > Package Explorer.  \n\u2022 Navigate to the software component SAP_FIN (or the tenant-specific package that contains namespace /EDO/GR*).  \n\u2022 Locate Enhancement Spot:  BADI_EDO_GREECE_XML ( \u201cGreece \u2013 Modify XML Before Submission\u201d ).  \n  \u2013 This enhancement spot is delivered empty so that you can add customer logic without a modification.\n\n2. Create your own BAdI implementation\n\n\u2022 Right-click the enhancement spot  BADI_EDO_GREECE_XML  \u2192 \u201cCreate BAdI Implementation \u2026\u201d.  \n\u2022 Enter a Z-name (e.g.  Z_BADI_EDO_GR_XML_ENH ) and short description.  \n\u2022 Choose Implementation Class (ZCL_BADI_EDO_GR_XML_ENH) to be generated.\n\n3. Implement the required method\n\n\u2022 ADT automatically opens the implementing class template with the single method:  \n\n      IF_EDO_GREECE_XML~MODIFY_XML(\n            EXPORTING\n              is_header          TYPE /edo/gr_s_edodoc_hdr\n              it_items           TYPE /edo/gr_t_edodoc_item\n            CHANGING\n              xml_string         TYPE string ).\n\n\u2022 Inside the method, use simple XSLT or string/DOM processing to inject, delete, or change nodes.  \n  \u2013 Example snippet (very short):  \n\n      DATA(lo_xml) = cl_sxml_string_reader=>create( xml_string ).\n      \"\u2026 parse, modify, serialise back \u2192 lv_new_xml \u2026\n      xml_string = lv_new_xml.\n\n4. Activate the implementation\n\n\u2022 Save and activate the class and the BAdI implementation object.  \n\u2022 No transport layer is needed in Private Cloud \u2013 the change is recorded automatically.\n\n5. Test the enhancement\n\n\u2022 In the ERP system run app \u201cDisplay eDocument\u201d (F2706) or transaction EDO_DISPLAY.  \n\u2022 Choose an existing Greece eDocument and press \u201cRe-Generate XML\u201d.  \n\u2022 The framework calls your BAdI; download the file to verify that your new element is present.  \n\n6. Move to productive use\n\n\u2022 Once validated in the Quality tenant, request a transport or lifecycle move to Production via SAP Cloud ALM or your standard move-to-prod process.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\nKey technical notes\n\n\u2022 The BAdI runs in the \u201cPrepare\u201d phase, before the adapter class posts the XML to the SAP DRC eDocument Cockpit and then to AADE.  \n\u2022 If multiple BAdIs are active, the execution order follows the filter value COMPANY_CODE; adjust the filter to ensure only Greece company codes are caught.  \n\u2022 Do not change mandatory AADE fields; otherwise AADE validation will fail (Error 302).  \n\u2022 SAP does not allow implicit enhancements in Private Cloud; using the released enhancement spot is the only supported option.\n\nPlain-language summary  \nOpen the delivered BAdI \u201cBADI_EDO_GREECE_XML\u201d in Eclipse, create your own Z-implementation, code the logic inside method MODIFY_XML to adapt the XML string, activate, and test\u2014this safely changes the eInvoice XML before it is sent to the Greek tax authority.",

    "generated_answer": "Technical explanation  \nYes \u2013 in SAP S/4HANA Private Cloud you can add your own \u201caction buttons\u201d (or change the behaviour of existing ones) in the eDocument Cockpit.  \nThe cockpit framework treats an action as a class that implements interface IF_EDOC_ACTION. SAP delivers a set of standard classes (CL_EDOC_ACTION_SUBMIT, _CANCEL, _RESEND \u2026). In Private Cloud you are allowed to create a Z-sub-class or a completely new class and register it as an additional action.\n\nHow to do it step-by-step  \n1. Copy or create the handler class  \n   SE24 (or ADT) \u2192 create class ZCL_EDOC_ACTION_ALT_SUBMIT  \n   Interfaces \u2192 IF_EDOC_ACTION  \n   Implement the two key methods  \n     METHOD if_edoc_action~get_description.  \n       rv_text = \u2018Send via alternative provider\u2019.  \n     ENDMETHOD.  \n\n     METHOD if_edoc_action~execute.  \n       \"Your custom logic here  \n       lo_doc = io_facade->get_edocument( ).  \n       \"call external service, write log, set status \u2026  \n       io_facade->add_log_entry( id = \u2018ZSUB\u2019 type = \u2018S\u2019 text = \u2018Sent successfully\u2019 ).  \n     ENDMETHOD.  \n\n2. Register the action in Customising  \n   SPRO \u2192 Cross-Application Components \u2192 Document and Reporting Compliance \u2192 eDocument Framework \u2192 Maintain Cockpit Actions (view V_EDOC_ACTC)  \n   \u2022 Action ID           ZSUB (4-char key)  \n   \u2022 Action type         03 (Custom)  \n   \u2022 Handler class       ZCL_EDOC_ACTION_ALT_SUBMIT  \n   \u2022 Icon / Tooltip      (optional)  \n\n3. Authorisation (optional)  \n   PFCG \u2192 object F_EDOC_ACT  \n   Activity = 16 \u201cExecute\u201d  \n   Action   = ZSUB  \n   Assign the role to users who should see the button.\n\n4. Make the button visible in the Fiori cockpit  \n   Run /UI5/APP_INDEX_CALCULATE (or wait for nightly index job).  \n   Reload the \u201cManage Electronic Documents\u201d app \u2013 the new button appears in the item toolbar whenever the selected document state allows execution (the framework calls your IF_EDOC_ACTION~IS_AVAILABLE method; override it if you need custom enable/disable logic).\n\n5. Transport & lifecycle  \n   \u2022 If you build the class in ADT/SE24, include it in a normal transport.  \n   \u2022 The V_EDOC_ACTC entry is Customising (workbench request if prompted).  \n   \u2022 Transports move through Q-gate the same way as any other Private Cloud extensions.\n\nUseful enhancement points around actions (for reference)  \n\u2022 BAdI EDOCUMENT_CUSTOM_FIELDS \u2013 add custom header/item data that your action might need.  \n\u2022 BAdI EDOCUMENT_CUSTOM_FIELDS_UI \u2013 show these fields on the cockpit screen.  \n\u2022 BAdI EDOC_ADAPTOR_* \u2013 adapt the XML you send after your action runs (e.g., insert Peppol extension).  \n\nMinimal code pattern  \n  METHOD if_edoc_action~execute.  \n    DATA(lo_facade) = io_facade.               \"passed by framework  \n    DATA(ls_hdr)    = lo_facade->get_header( ).  \n    \"1) call your outbound API  \n    zcl_alt_provider_api=>send( ls_hdr ).  \n    \"2) write cockpit log  \n    lo_facade->add_log_entry( id = 'ZSUB' type = 'S'  \n                              text = |Alternative submission ID { zcl_alt_provider_api=>gv_ticket }| ).  \n    \"3) optionally change document status  \n    lo_facade->set_status( zcl_const=>c_status-sent ).  \n  ENDMETHOD.  \n\nPlain-language summary  \nYes \u2013 in S/4HANA Private Cloud you can add or extend actions in the eDocument Cockpit: build a new ABAP class that implements IF_EDOC_ACTION, register it in Customising view V_EDOC_ACTC, assign authorisations, and the cockpit automatically shows your new button so users can run your custom process.",

In an S/4HANA Private-Cloud system running SAP Document and Reporting Compliance (DRC) you can restrict which electronic documents a user can see in \u201cManage Electronic Documents\u201d (Fiori F4306) or the legacy eDocument Cockpit by using a custom field that you add through DRC extensibility. The mechanism combines (1) a custom field at e-document header level, (2) a BAdI implementation that fills the field automatically, and (3) the delivered restriction type \u201cElectronic Document \u2013 Restriction for Organisational Unit\u201d (or any custom restriction type) that you activate in business roles.\n\nEnd-to-end steps  \n\n1. Create the custom field  \n   \u2022 Fiori app \u201cCustom Fields and Logic\u201d \u2192 Business Context: Electronic Document Header (EDOCUMENT_HDR).  \n   \u2022 Example: ZZ_ORGUNIT (code/list, length 4).  \n   \u2022 Expose it to \u201cManage Electronic Documents\u201d (tick UI & Reports). Publish.\n\n2. Populate the field during e-document creation  \n   \u2022 Implement BAdI EDOC_BEFORE_PERSIST (Enh. Spot EDOCUMENT_BADI) or BAdI EDOC_MAP_EXT_FIELDS.  \n   \u2022 Sample code  \n\n     IF is_billing_header IS NOT INITIAL.  \n        es_edocument-zz_orgunit = is_billing_header-vkorg.  \"copy sales org  \n     ENDIF.\n\n3. Define the organisational-unit values  \n   \u2022 SPRO \u2192 Cross-Application Components \u2192 Document & Reporting Compliance \u2192 Authorisation Management \u2192 Define Organisational Units for Authorisation.  \n   \u2022 Enter the units (e.g. 1000, 2000) and link them to the corresponding DRC process (outbound invoice, credit memo \u2026).\n\n4. Add the restriction type to business roles  \n   \u2022 Fiori \u201cMaintain Business Roles\u201d (F4183) or PFCG.  \n   \u2022 Role must already contain catalog SAP_SD_BC_GLO_EDOC_PC.  \n   \u2022 Under \u201cRestrict Value Help\u201d choose restriction type RST_E_DOC_ORGU, field ZZ_ORGUNIT, maintain allowed values per role.  \n   \u2022 Generate the role and assign to users.\n\n5. (Optional) show the field on the list/filter bar  \n   \u2022 Use \u201cAdapt UI\u201d on app F4306; add the ZZ_ORGUNIT column or filter field.\n\nResult  \nWhen a user opens Manage Electronic Documents, the OData service API_EDOCUMENT_MANAGE checks the restriction type. Only documents whose EDOCUMENT-ZZ_ORGUNIT value matches the values in the user\u2019s role are returned\u2014effectively controlling visibility by your custom criterion.\n\nPlain-language summary  \nYes\u2014by adding a custom header field and linking it to the delivered authorisation restriction, you can make each user in Private Cloud see only the electronic documents that match the values (e.g. their sales or company code) you assign in their role.",

    "generated_answer": "Technical explanation (root cause & fix)\n\n1. Error CF366 \u201cTax-exemption reason is required\u201d  \n   \u2022 The Malaysia XML generator (class CL_EDO_MY_EINVOICE) checks every item whose internal tax code is mapped to external Tax Type E = \u201cExempt\u201d.  \n   \u2022 The check reads the exemption-reason text through the text type defined in SSCUI EXEMPT_TEXT_TYPE (default 0001-Material Sales Text).  \n   \u2022 If the text is empty, message class EDO_MY, message CF366, is raised during submission.\n\n   What to do  \n   a. Configuration \u2192 SSCUI \u201cConfiguring Value Mapping for Tax Types (MY_TAX_MAP)\u201d  \n      \u2013 Make sure only your genuinely exempt tax codes (Z0, A0, SR-0\u2026) are mapped to external Tax Type E.  \n   b. Configuration \u2192 SSCUI \u201cText Type for Tax Exemption Reason (EXEMPT_TEXT_TYPE)\u201d  \n      \u2013 Maintain the SD/FI text type that will carry the reason (e.g. keep 0001 or define your own).  \n   c. Master data / document entry  \n      \u2013 Enter the exemption reason in the source document under that text type:  \n        \u2022 SD billing (VF01/VA01) \u2192 Item Texts tab \u2192 text type 0001.  \n        \u2022 FI invoice (FB70/MIRO) \u2192 Line-item text (BSEG-SGTXT).  \n   d. Resubmit the eDocument. XML now contains both <TaxCategoryCode>E</TaxCategoryCode> and <TaxExemptionReason>\u2026</TaxExemptionReason>, so CF366 disappears.\n\n2. CurrencyCode in <TaxAmount> shows plant code  \n   \u2022 This symptom is typically caused by an incorrect entry in value mapping table MY_CURR_MAP (or a Z-copy) where the \u201cInternal Value\u201d column has been filled with plant instead of currency key.  \n   \u2022 Check SSCUI \u201cValue Mapping for Currency Codes (if used)\u201d or AIF value mapping in namespace /EDOMY/*:  \n     \u2013 Internal Value \u2192 ISO currency code (MYR, USD \u2026)  \n     \u2013 External Value \u2192 must remain identical because Malaysia eInvoice expects ISO code.  \n   \u2022 Correct the mapping, regenerate and resend; <TaxAmount currencyID=\"MYR\"> will be produced.\n\nQuick checklist\n\u2713 MY_TAX_MAP: exempt tax codes \u2192 external type E  \n\u2713 EXEMPT_TEXT_TYPE: text type maintained  \n\u2713 Reason text entered in source document  \n\u2713 Currency value mapping contains ISO currency codes, not plant numbers  \n\u2713 Source document types and company codes activated for eDocument processing\n\nOnce the above settings are consistent, the document 5100000296 2024 can be submitted without CF366 and the XML will show the right currency code.\n\nPlain-language summary  \nAdd the exemption reason text to your invoice (using the text type defined in EXEMPT_TEXT_TYPE) and fix any currency-code value mapping that mistakenly points to a plant; afterwards the Malaysia eDocument will submit successfully.",

    "generated_answer": "Technical explanation  \n\u2022 When an import supplier invoice is submitted from MIRO to SAP Document & Reporting Compliance (DRC) the framework looks for the \u201creference number of customs form\u201d in the purchase-order-header text ID defined in IMG \u2192 Materials Management \u2192 Purchasing \u2192 Texts \u2192 Define Text Types for Purchase Order Header.  \n\u2022 SAP Note 3487313 clarifies that the text ID configured in that step must be entered in field IMPORT_TEXT_TYPE in view /V_EDO_INT_MM (or via SPRO activity \u201cAssign Text Type for Import Reference Numbers\u201d).  \n\u2022 At runtime class CL_EDO_MM_MAP_* reads that text ID; if it finds a text it copies the content 1:1 into XML element <CustomsFormReference>. The XML schema used by the receiving customs web service rejects characters outside the allowed set (letters, digits, \u201c , . \u2013 / _ \u201d etc.).  \n\u2022 Your customer enhancement currently bypasses this logic: it reads the first header text of the goods-movement document (MIGO) instead of the PO text and pushes it into the same XML field. Because no IMPORT_TEXT_TYPE was maintained in the PO the enhancement returns an empty string; the framework therefore falls back to the PO header reference (RBKP-XBLNR) which in your test case contains characters that are illegal in the target XML \u2192 application-log message \u201cspecial characters are not allowed for reference number of customs form\u201d.\n\nHow to solve  \n1. Master-data correction (recommended)  \n   \u2022 Open the PO in ME22N \u2192 Header \u2192 Texts.  \n   \u2022 Maintain the text type that you assigned as IMPORT_TEXT_TYPE (for example \u201cBOL_CNTR\u201d or any custom ID) with the desired customs-form number \u2014 and only with allowed characters.  \n   \u2022 Save and recreate the supplier invoice. The XML/PDF will now show the correct reference.  \n\n2. Character-filtering exit (if users occasionally paste forbidden symbols)  \n   \u2022 Implement BAdI EDOC_ADAPTOR, method SET_OUTPUT_DATA.  \n   \u2022 Add a short routine such as  \n     ```abap\n     REPLACE ALL OCCURRENCES OF REGEX '[^A-Za-z0-9./_-]' IN ls_xml-customs_ref WITH ''.\n     ```  \n   \u2022 This strips any character the customs interface cannot accept before the XML is generated.  \n\n3. Adjust the custom mapping (if you really need to read MIGO text)  \n   \u2022 Enhance your code to call function module CONVERSION_EXIT_ALPHA_INPUT (or similar) and to remove forbidden characters as above.  \n   \u2022 Alternatively change the source to read the correct PO text via READ_TEXT with the key (TDOBJECT = \u2018EKKO\u2019, TDID = IMPORT_TEXT_TYPE, TDNAME = PO number).  \n\nQuick test script  \n```abap\nDATA lv_text TYPE string.\nCALL FUNCTION 'READ_TEXT'\n  EXPORTING\n    id       = 'BOL_CNTR'        \"IMPORT_TEXT_TYPE\n    language = sy-langu\n    name     = ekko-ebeln\n    object   = 'EKKO'\n  TABLES\n    lines    = lt_lines.\nLOOP AT lt_lines INTO DATA(ls_line).\n  lv_text = |{ lv_text }{ ls_line-tdline }|.\nENDLOOP.\n\" remove illegal characters\nREPLACE ALL OCCURRENCES OF REGEX '[^A-Za-z0-9./_-]' IN lv_text WITH ''.\n```\n\nPlain-language summary  \nMaintain the customs-form reference in the purchase-order header text type that SAP calls \u201cIMPORT_TEXT_TYPE\u201d, or strip forbidden symbols in a BAdI; otherwise DRC rejects the invoice because the reference number contains characters not allowed by the customs XML schema.",

It directly addresses the user's issue of being unable to access the Peppol Exchange Process app despite having the necessary BTP roles.\n\n2. It correctly identifies that the problem is not with the BTP roles but with the S/4HANA Cloud business catalog assignments, which aligns with the authoritative information from the sap_documentation_summary tool.\n\n3. It provides a detailed, step-by-step solution to resolve the issue, including:\n   - Adding the business catalog SAP_CA_BC_EDOC_PAP_PC to a business role in S/4HANA Cloud.\n   - Assigning this role to the user in S/4HANA Cloud.\n   - Instructions for BTP Launchpad Service users to assign the corresponding role collection.\n\n4. The answer includes a quick checklist for verification, which is helpful for the user to ensure all steps are completed.\n\n5. It offers a plain-language summary that encapsulates the core solution, making it easy for the user to understand the key action needed.\n\n6. The answer goes beyond the expert answer by providing more comprehensive and specific instructions to resolve the issue.\n\nWhile the expert answer suggests a simple log off and log in or browser refresh, which may sometimes work, the generated answer addresses the root cause of the problem and provides a more robust, long-term solution. This makes the generated answer more helpful and likely to resolve the issue permanently.\n\nThe answer is consistent with the information provided by the sap_documentation_summary tool, which emphasizes the importance of correct role and catalog assignments for Peppol Exchange process integration.\n\nGiven these factors, the generated answer fully addresses the user's question and provides accurate, actionable information to resolve the access issue.",

Why a certificate is requested  \n   \u2022 In the Peppol scenario SAP Document & Reporting Compliance, cloud edition (DRC-CE) calls your S/4HANA Cloud tenant (inbound status update, attachment download, etc.).  \n   \u2022 For inbound calls S/4HANA Cloud accepts only mutual-TLS (\u201cSSL Client Certificate\u201d) \u2013 therefore the Fiori app \u201cMaintain Communication Users\u201d asks you to attach the caller\u2019s public X.509 certificate.\n\n2. Where the certificate comes from  \n   \u2022 The caller is the SAP-managed Peppol Access Point that runs on SAP BTP.  \n   \u2022 Its client certificate is delivered automatically when you create a service key for your Peppol Exchange service instance on BTP.  \n     \u2013 BTP Cockpit \u25b6 Instances & Subscriptions \u25b6 your Peppol service instance  \n     \u2013 \u201cCreate Service Key\u201d \u2192 choose JSON option  \n     \u2013 In the parameters set  \n         { \"xsuaa\": { \"credential-type\": \"x509\" } }  \n     \u2013 The JSON result contains a field  \n         \"certificate\": \"-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE----- \u2026 -----END CERTIFICATE-----\"  \n   \u2022 Copy the block (including the BEGIN/END lines) into a text file and save it as pepol_ap.crt (PEM format).  \n   \u2022 This is the file you upload in the \u201cMaintain Communication Users\u201d screen.\n\n3. File format accepted by S/4HANA Cloud  \n   \u2022 Base-64 encoded X.509 in PEM or CRT/ CER extension.  \n   \u2022 DER is also accepted but PEM is the simplest because the service key already shows PEM.\n\n4. Steps in S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition  \n   1. Launchpad \u25b6 Maintain Communication Users \u2192 Create (e.g. PEPPOLEX_IN)  \n   2. Leave password empty, press \u201cAdd Certificate\u201d, upload pepol_ap.crt, Save.  \n   3. Create/Update the communication arrangement for the Peppol scenario (e.g. SAP_COM_0529) via \u201cCreate by Service Key\u201d (or \u201cUpdate by Service Key\u201d) and paste the same service-key JSON.  \n      \u2022 The system generates/links the communication system automatically and picks the user you just created.\n\n5. Outbound direction (S/4 \u279c Peppol Access Point)  \n   \u2022 No certificate upload is necessary. S/4HANA Cloud presents its own \u201cDefault Client Certificate\u201d.  \n   \u2022 You can export this certificate in Fiori app \u201cMaintain Client Certificates\u201d if the Peppol service key needs it (same procedure, save as default_client.crt and insert it in the JSON you send when creating the service key).\n\nPlain-language summary  \nThe certificate you are supposed to upload is NOT something you purchase elsewhere\u2014it is automatically issued for your SAP-managed Peppol Access Point. Create a service key for the Peppol Exchange service in SAP BTP, copy the \u201c-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE----- \u2026\u201d block, save it as a .crt or .pem file, and upload that file to the communication user in S/4HANA Cloud.",

Instead of using VAT IDs, consider using a more flexible identifier such as the Global Location Number (GLN). GLNs can be used across different systems without causing conflicts. This approach is particularly useful when you have multiple systems or company codes that need to be uniquely identified.

    "generated_answer": "Technical explanation\n1. Uniqueness rule in SAP DRC/Peppol  \n   \u2022 When you flag a tax number (for example the company\u2019s VAT ID) as the \u201cParty-ID\u201d for a company code in configuration (SSCUI \u201cAssign Party ID Types to Companies\u201d), the system stores it as the Peppol participant ID.  \n   \u2022 The value must be unique across all company codes that report through the same DRC tenant. Class /DSC/CL_PARTICIPANT_CHECK (delivered with SAP Note 2926868) validates this at save time and at runtime.  \n   \u2022 If the same VAT ID already exists for another company code, message /DSC/CUST_MSG 005 \u201cDuplicate tax ID / participant ID\u201d is raised \u2013 exactly what you are seeing.\n\n2. Why it matters with two back-end systems  \n   \u2022 The Peppol network can route a document to only one destination per participant ID.  \n   \u2022 If your IS-U and S/4HANA systems both tried to use VAT-DK12345678 as participant ID, the cloud service would not know to which system an incoming invoice or acknowledgment must be forwarded.  \n   \u2022 Therefore SAP requires that each technical destination has its own, unique Peppol participant.\n\n3. Resolution options  \n   a) Register different Peppol participants for each system  \n      \u2013 Keep the legal VAT number for the company that will be the main Peppol endpoint (e.g. S/4HANA).  \n      \u2013 For the second system create a different participant ID, typically based on a Global Location Number (GLN) or another allowed scheme.  \n      \u2013 In \u201cAssign Party ID Types to Companies\u201d link the IS-U company code to that new ID type/value (for example party-ID type \u201c0088 GLN\u201d, value 5790000123456).  \n   b) Use branch-specific VAT / tax numbers if the tax authority has issued them.  \n   c) If you must share one VAT ID for legal reasons, connect only one of the systems directly to Peppol and let the other forward its documents through it (single gateway scenario).\n\n4. Concrete configuration steps (CBC / Manage Your Solution)  \n   1. Edit Tax Information for Company Codes (SSCUI 105675) \u2013 make sure field \u201cVAT Registration No.\u201d is filled only for the company that should use the VAT as participant.  \n   2. Maintain Additional Parameters \u2192 add parameter PAP001 (Generic Peppol Participant ID) with the GLN or other unique ID for the second company code.  \n   3. Assign Party ID Types to Companies \u2013 map:  \n        \u2022 Company A \u2192 Party-ID-Type \u201cVAT\u201d \u2192 DK12345678  \n        \u2022 Company B \u2192 Party-ID-Type \u201cGLN\u201d \u2192 5790000123456  \n   4. Save and transport; the duplicate-ID error disappears.\n\nShort example\nCompany code 1000 (S/4):  \n\u2003Party-ID-Type = DK:VAT\u2003Party-ID = DK12345678  \n\nCompany code 2000 (IS-U):  \n\u2003Party-ID-Type = 0088 (GLN)\u2003Party-ID = 5790000123456  \n\nPlain-language summary\nPeppol and SAP DRC allow only one backend system per participant ID\u2014so two systems cannot both register with the same VAT number. Give each system its own participant (for example one keeps the VAT ID, the other gets a GLN) or route everything through a single gateway; after you change the mapping, the duplicate-VAT error goes away.",

    "generated_answer": "Technical explanation  \nThe \u201cReceived by sender access point\u201d state means the Peppol Exchange tried to PUSH the response XML back to your on-premise/S/4HANA system, but the HTTP call to your SAP back end was rejected with status 401 (Unauthorized). The HTML returned (\u201cAnmeldung fehlgeschlagen / log-on failed\u201d) is generated by your SAP NetWeaver application server, not by Peppol. Peppol Exchange therefore never gets past the PUSH step, and the document remains queued.\n\nBased on SAP\u2019s official troubleshooting content (see edp_troubleshooting_search result), the 401 appears almost exclusively when one of the following is wrong:\n\n1. Wrong user/password in Peppol Exchange \u2192 Connection Management  \n   \u2022 In the dashboard open Connection Management \u2192 pick the affected logical connection.  \n   \u2022 Field \u201cUser (Back-End)\u201d must contain an actual dialog/communication user that exists in the SAP back-end client.  \n   \u2022 Reset the password in SU01, then paste exactly the same password in Connection Management (\u2264200 chars).  \n\n2. Cloud Connector or Location ID mismatch  \n   \u2022 The \u201cSubaccount User\u201d maintained in Cloud Connector must be the same ID you entered in Connection Management.  \n   \u2022 Location ID (if used) must be identical in both places.  \n\n3. Missing or wrong authorizations for that user  \n   \u2022 User must hold AIF and eDocument authorizations (objects /SAPSLL/*, /AIF/*, EDOC_*).  \n   \u2022 Check SU53 immediately after a failed PUSH (System Logs Monitor can show the exact object that failed).  \n\n4. Client certificate issues (if you configured mutual TLS instead of basic auth)  \n   \u2022 Verify the certificate uploaded in Connection Management is still valid and that the same certificate is active in SOAMANAGER logical port used for inbound AIF service.  \n   \u2022 If in doubt, delete and re-upload the certificate, then restart the connection test.  \n\n5. Peppol Exchange still points to an old hostname after system move  \n   \u2022 Ensure the hostname in Connection Management matches what Cloud Connector exposes (including port and HTTPS).  \n\nQuick test path  \nSEGW \u2192 /IWFND/MAINT_SERVICE (activate service EDOC_INBOUND*)  \nSMICM \u2192 Goto \u2192 Services (confirm HTTPS port open)  \nSOAMANAGER \u2192 Web Service Configuration \u2192 service group \u201cEDOC_INBOUND_PUSH\u201d \u2192 Ping Service (should show HTTP 200, not 401).\n\nIf the Ping returns 200 but Peppol still shows 401, the password stored in Peppol Exchange is outdated\u2014reset and test again. After fixing the credential or authorization problem, choose \u201cRetry Push\u201d in the Peppol dashboard or let the overnight scheduler resend; the status should move forward to \u201cDelivered to receiver back end\u201d.\n\nPlain-language summary  \nThe access point cannot log on to your SAP system; check and correct the user/password (or certificate) stored in Peppol Exchange and make sure that same user exists, is authorized, and matches the Cloud Connector setup\u2014once the SAP server accepts the call (HTTP 200) the document will leave the \u201cReceived by sender access point\u201d status.",

By inserting the additional line  \n   `AND mo_source->mv_source_type <> cl_edoc_source_stlmt=>gc_src_stlmt_inv`  \n   SAP makes sure Settlement-Management invoices fall through the IF-block, thereby keeping `rv_relevant = abap_true`.  \n3. All subsequent logic (cancellation check, adaptor BAdI, etc.) is then executed for STLMT documents, enabling eDocument generation and downstream UBL mapping (which re-uses class CL_EDOC_MAP_UBL_STLMT and its simulation of SD billing).\n\nPlain-language summary\nSAP enabled Settlement-Management invoices for French e-Invoicing by adding the source-type key STLMT_INV to the white-list inside CL_EDOCUMENT_FR_INV\u2192IS_RELEVANT; this single line lets the framework create eDocuments and execute the usual mapping logic for those documents.",

Uses the Settlement Management header (WBRK) and first item (WBRP) to derive the \u201cActual Delivery Date\u201d.  \n2. Reads the corresponding partner records from table WBPA (analogous to VBPA in SD) to obtain Ship-to or Goods-recipient information.  \n3. Fills VAT-ID and structured postal address exactly as the standard SD implementation (re-using helper method FILL_ADDRESS).  \n4. Adds a delivery-party name only if it differs from the invoice\u2019s customer name (requirement from Peppol/EN-16931).  \n5. Returns the fully populated structure RS_EDO_FR_DELIVERY to the mapping framework.\n\nPlain-language summary  \nReplace the empty SM mapping class with the code above; it copies the logic SAP already uses for SD invoices but reads its data from WBRK/WBRP/WBPA, thereby enabling the \u201cSettlement Management Documents\u201d source type for French B2B eInvoices.",

Country-specific reuse pattern  \n   \u2013 For every country that later introduced Settlement-Management (STLMT) support, SAP delivered a \u201c_STLMT\u201d class that simply inherits from the existing country base mapping class:  \n     * CL_EDOC_MAP_MX_STLMT \u2192 CL_EDOC_MAP_MX  \n     * CL_EDOC_MAP_RS_STLMT \u2192 CL_EDOC_MAP_RS  \n     * CL_EDOC_MAP_KR_STLMT \u2192 CL_EDOC_MAP_KR  \n     * CL_EDOC_MAP_FR_EREP_DOC_STLMT \u2192 CL_EDOC_MAP_FR_EREP_DOC (already in France scope, but for e-Reporting)  \n   \u2013 Following the same pattern keeps your coding consistent with SAP standard.\n\n2. Functional overlap  \n   \u2013 CL_EDOC_MAP_FR_B2B already contains all France-specific B2B rules: XML envelope, profile IDs, tax-scheme mappings, fixed values, BADI hooks, and error handling.  \n   \u2013 Settlement-Management invoices differ only in data source (KOMLF* instead of VBRK/P) and a few additional tags; those can be added on top by redefining only init_mapping / fill_invoice_* methods.  \n   \u2013 Inheriting avoids re-implementing French legal specifics, fixed-value retrieval, and AIF error aggregation.\n\n3. Minimal duplicate code  \n   \u2013 super\u2192init_mapping( ) can still be called after you collect Settlement-Management partner/address data (see MX/RS patterns).  \n   \u2013 Only STLMT-specific logic (simulation of SD billing, additional references, etc.) needs to be coded in the subclass.\n\nSkeleton example  \n\nCLASS cl_edoc_map_fr_b2b_stlmt DEFINITION  \n  PUBLIC INHERITING FROM cl_edoc_map_fr_b2b.  \n  PUBLIC SECTION.  \n    METHODS constructor  \n      IMPORTING  \n        !iv_source_type    TYPE edoc_source_type  \n        \u2026 .  \n  PROTECTED SECTION.  \n    METHODS init_mapping REDEFINITION.  \n    METHODS fill_invoice_stlmt CHANGING cs_target TYPE edo_fr_invoice_request.  \nENDCLASS.\n\nMETHOD cl_edoc_map_fr_b2b_stlmt\u2192init_mapping.  \n  \"Set STLMT-specific currency, partner and KOMLFK/LFP data  \n  \u2026  \n  \"Call common French mapping from superclass  \n  super->init_mapping( iv_bukrs = ms_source-komlfk-bukrs  \n                       iv_kunnr = ms_source-komlfk-kunrg  \n                       iv_adrnr = lv_adrnr ).  \nENDMETHOD.\n\nPlain-language takeaway  \nPick CL_EDOC_MAP_FR_B2B as the superclass; it already contains all French B2B specifics, so your new Settlement-Management mapping class only has to add the settlement-related bits instead of duplicating the whole country logic.",
