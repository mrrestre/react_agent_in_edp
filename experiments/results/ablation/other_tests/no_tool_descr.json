    "answer": "To attach additional files to the standard XML in Public Cloud, you can use the Business Add-In (BAdI) EDOC_ADAPTOR_CLOUD and enhance the XML file generated for an electronic document.\nBy enhancing the XML file, you can include additional information that may be relevant for your business processes .\nTo implement this enhancement, you can follow these steps in ABAP Development Tools (ADT):\n1. In your ABAP project, go to the enhancement spot ES_EDOCUMENT_CLOUD and select 'New BAdI Enhancement Implementation'.\n2. Enter a package, name, and description for the implementation.\n3. Choose 'Add BAdI Implementation' and select EDOC_ADAPTOR_CLOUD .\n4. (Optional) Create a BAdI filter for Country and/or Generic Filter.\n5. Choose 'Implementing Class' to create a new implementation class.\n6. Activate your BAdI implementation .\nOnce you have implemented the BAdI, you can fill the XML tag <BuyersItemIdentification> with the desired additional information.\nThis can be done by reading the relevant data from the source documents and filling the appropriate XML tags.\nPlease note that the specific implementation details may vary depending on your system setup and requirements.\nIt is recommended to refer to the provided sources for more detailed instructions and examples.",

It covers the key points mentioned in the expert answer and provides additional details from the SAP documentation. However, there are a few reasons why it's not fully helpful:\n\n1. The generated answer focuses more on the technical implementation details rather than providing a high-level overview of the process, which might be overwhelming for some users.\n\n2. While the expert answer mentions using the Business Add-In (BAdI) EDOC_ADAPTOR_CLOUD, the generated answer refers to a more specific method, SET_OUTPUT_DATA, which is correct but might be confusing for users not familiar with the exact BAdI structure.\n\n3. The generated answer provides a code snippet, which is helpful, but it doesn't explain each step of the implementation process as clearly as the expert answer does.\n\n4. The generated answer doesn't mention the use of ABAP Development Tools (ADT) for implementation, which is an important point in the expert answer.\n\n5. The generated answer correctly mentions the need to check if the legal format and authority's platforms support attachments, which is a valuable addition not present in the expert answer.\n\nOverall, while the generated answer is technically accurate and provides valuable information, it could be more user-friendly and better structured to match the clarity of the expert answer. It partially addresses the question but may require additional explanation or simplification for some users to fully understand and implement the solution.",

    "generated_answer": "Technical explanation  \n\u2022 In SAP S/4HANA Cloud, public edition, the Greece e-invoice (myDATA) XML can be modified only through the cloud-released BAdI \u201cEDOC_ADAPTOR_CLOUD\u201d.  \n  \u2013 Method to implement: SET_OUTPUT_DATA.  \n  \u2013 Purpose (tool output #1 \u2013 sap_documentation_summary): \u201cCloud EDOC Adaptor BADI allows users to fill XML fields that are not filled in the standard mapping or to make changes to the values of the XML fields \u2026 and, if required, stop the processing with an error message.\u201d  \n\u2022 The classic on-premise post-processing BAdI/transaction EDOC_XML_POSTPROC is NOT available in public-cloud tenants (tool output #2 \u2013 sap_help_lookup).  \n\u2022 Typical implementation flow  \n  1. Launch Fiori app \u201cCustom Logic\u201d (F1481) or use ADT in a 3-system developer-extensibility landscape.  \n  2. Create a new enhancement implementation for Business Context \u201cElectronic Document \u2013 Cloud Adaptor\u201d (spot IF_BADI_EDOC_ADAPTOR_CLOUD).  \n  3. In SET_OUTPUT_DATA receive the XML as XSTRING, adjust it (e.g. add customer material number in <Item/AdditionalInfo>), then return the updated XSTRING.  \n  4. Optional: perform additional validation and, if errors exist, append messages to CT_RETURN; this stops submission and the cockpit shows the error.  \n  5. Regenerate the XML in the eDocument Cockpit and resend.  \n\u2022 Limits / compliance rules  \n  \u2013 Do not change the root structure or mandatory nodes defined by the AADE myDATA schema; otherwise the authority validation will fail.  \n  \u2013 Your code runs before the \u201cSend to Tax Authority\u201d step, so no additional transport mechanism is needed.  \n  \u2013 Because all logic sits inside the cloud-released BAdI, the enhancement survives upgrades; still re-test after each quarterly release.  \n\u2022 Alternative if deep restructuring is required: generate the standard XML, call an SAP BTP transformation service via an outbound integration flow, and submit the transformed file from BTP.\n\nTiny code snippet (ADT)  \nMETHOD if_badi_edoc_adaptor_cloud~set_output_data.  \n  DATA lt_xml TYPE xstring.  \n  lt_xml = is_output_data.                  \"original XML  \n  \"\u2026perform XML manipulation here\u2026  \n  es_output_data = lt_xml.                  \"return new XML  \n  \"raise error example  \n  IF validation_failed = abap_true.  \n    APPEND VALUE #( type = 'E' id = 'EDOCUMENT' number = '999'  \n                    message = |Invalid <CustomerMaterial>| ) TO ct_return.  \n  ENDIF.  \nENDMETHOD.\n\nPlain-language takeaway  \nYes \u2013 you can enrich or tweak the Greece myDATA invoice XML in Public Cloud, but you must do it via the cloud-released BAdI EDOC_ADAPTOR_CLOUD (method SET_OUTPUT_DATA); the older EDOC_XML_POSTPROC hook is not available.",

Process/Action customizing (no coding)  \n   \u2022 Open Fiori app \u201cManage eDocument Process\u201d.  \n   \u2022 Create (or copy) your custom Process and add  \n     \u2013 a Process Step (e.g. SENDTOCUST) with an implementation class,  \n     \u2013 a Status Flag that the step will set,  \n     \u2013 an Action code (same name, e.g. SENDTOCUST), then  \n     \u2013 link the Action \u2192 Process Step in section \u201cProcess Steps executed by an Action\u201d, and assign the Action to the toolbar in \u201cProcess Toolbar Function Assignment\u201d.  \n   (See SAP-Help extract above: steps, flags, and assignments are stored in tables EDOC_PRC_*.)\n\n2. Runtime logic (ABAP BAdI)  \n   \u2022 Implement BAdI EDOCUMENT_INT_CONN_EXT (or another action-specific BAdI such as EDOC_PART_CONN_CHANGE_EMAIL_V2) in the \u201cCustom Logic\u201d app / ADT.  \n   \u2022 In method TRIGGER you perform whatever the new Action shall do (call an external API, write AIF messages, etc.) and update the process status; utilities are available in class CL_EDOCUMENT_EXT_ES.  \n   (Tool output shows the call sequence: Cockpit \u2192 country/handler class \u2192 framework \u2192 BAdI.)\n\nBecause private-edition allows developer extensibility, you may create your handler / mapping classes in a customer namespace (ZCL_\u2026); the BAdI implementation is then filtered by country, process, or action.\n\nPractical mini-example  \n\u2022 Add Action \u201cSENDTOCUST\u201d (button text \u201cCustomer\u201d).  \n\u2022 BAdI implementation ZCL_BADI_EDOC_INT_CUST:  \n  TRIGGER( ) calls your REST proxy to a customer portal, saves the request/response in eDocument attachments, and sets flag SENTTOCUST = \u2018X\u2019.  \n\u2022 Cockpit now shows the new button only when the prerequisite flags are set; when pressed it executes your code and updates status.\n\nPlain-language summary  \nIn your private-cloud system you can indeed add your own button to the eDocument Cockpit; you configure the button in the \u201cManage eDocument Process\u201d app and write the processing logic in the released eDocument Action BAdI.",

Prerequisites  \n   \u2022 You are in SAP S/4HANA Cloud, public edition and Developer Extensibility is available.  \n   \u2022 You have the ABAP Development Tools (ADT) plug-in installed.\n\n2. Create the custom field  \n   \u2013 Open the \u201cCustom Fields\u201d Fiori app \u2192 Create.  \n   \u2013 Choose a Business Context that belongs to the eDocument object (for example \u201cElectronic Document: Header\u201d).  \n   \u2013 Enter the field name (e.g. YY1_TOTAL_WEIGHT) and datatype.  \n   \u2013 Publish the field.  \n   Result: the field is now part of the data dictionary and can be consumed in ABAP.\n\n3. Start the enhancement in ADT  \n   \u2013 In your ABAP project navigate to package GLO-EDO \u2192 Enhancements \u2192 Enhancement Spots.  \n   \u2013 Open spot ES_EDOCUMENT_CLOUD.  \n   \u2013 Right-click \u2192 New BAdI Enhancement Implementation.\n\n4. Add the BAdI implementation  \n   \u2013 In the wizard choose Add BAdI Implementation and pick BAdI EDOC_CUSTOM_FIELDS_CLOUD.  \n   \u2013 Provide a name, description and package (your own YY1/Z* package).  \n   \u2013 Maintain a BAdI filter for the eDocument process you extend (e.g. EDOC_PROCESS = \u2018MM_IV\u2019).\n\n5. Implement the ABAP class  \n   \u2013 The wizard creates a class that automatically implements IF_BADI_INTERFACE and IF_EDOC_CUSTOM_FIELDS_CLOUD.  \n   \u2013 In the method FILL_EDOC_CUSTOM_FIELDS (comes from IF_EDOC_CUSTOM_FIELDS_CLOUD) add code similar to:\n\n```\nMETHOD if_edoc_custom_fields_cloud~fill_edoc_custom_fields.\n  DATA ls_field_data TYPE edoc_s_custom_field.\n  CLEAR ls_field_data.\n  ls_field_data-fieldname  = 'YY1_TOTAL_WEIGHT'.\n  ls_field_data-fieldvalue = <derive weight from source doc>.\n  APPEND ls_field_data TO et_field_data.\nENDMETHOD.\n```\n\n   \u2013 Activate the class and enhancement implementation.\n\n6. Control cockpit behaviour (optional)  \n   \u2013 Open the \u201cCustom Logic\u201d app \u2192 BAdI: EDOC_CUSTOM_FIELDS_UI_CLOUD.  \n   \u2013 Adjust visibility, column text or tooltip for your new column in the eDocument cockpit.\n\n7. Test  \n   \u2013 Create a new billing or accounting document that triggers the eDocument process.  \n   \u2013 In eDocument Cockpit (EDOC_COCKPIT) display the generated document; the new column appears and shows the value supplied by your class.  \n   Note: the change applies only to documents created after the BAdI went live.\n\nKey references (tool output)\n\u2022 Enhancement spot ES_EDOCUMENT_CLOUD and BAdI EDOC_CUSTOM_FIELDS_CLOUD are used to inject the field (sap_documentation_summary).  \n\u2022 Method FILL_EDOC_CUSTOM_FIELDS is where the custom field is filled (sap_documentation_summary).  \n\u2022 UI attributes are set through BAdI EDOC_CUSTOM_FIELDS_UI_CLOUD in the Custom Logic app (sap_documentation_summary).\n\nOne-sentence plain-language summary  \nCreate the field in \u201cCustom Fields\u201d, add a BAdI implementation for EDOC_CUSTOM_FIELDS_CLOUD in ADT, fill the field in method FILL_EDOC_CUSTOM_FIELDS, optionally tune its cockpit display in the Custom Logic app, and your new column is available for every newly generated eDocument.",

Add a custom field that will hold the value you want to secure on (most customers use an organisational unit such as Sales Org or Profit Centre).  \n   \u2022 Key-user tool: Fiori app \u201cCustom Fields and Logic\u201d (F1481).  \n   \u2022 Business context: \u201cElectronic Document Header\u201d (object name EDO_COCKPIT_DOCHDR).  \n   \u2022 Publish the field and enable it for the Manage Electronic Documents UI and OData service EDO_COCKPIT_SRV.\n\n2. Fill that field whenever an eDocument is created.  \n   \u2022 Cloud BAdI: EDO_E_DOCUMENT_HDR_MODIFY.  \n   \u2022 On-prem BAdI: EDOCUMENT_HEADER_EXT.  \n   Example (pseudo ABAP):  \n   ```\n   SELECT SINGLE vkorg FROM vbrk INTO @lv_org WHERE vbeln = @source-vbeln.\n   edoc_e_document_hdr-yy1_orgunit_cd = lv_org.      \"custom field\n   ```\n\n3. SAP ships an IAM restriction type exactly for this purpose: \u201cEDO_ORG \u2013 Electronic Document: Restriction for Organizational Unit\u201d.  \n   \u2022 The ABAP utility class CL_EDOC_DCC_UTILITY\u2192CHECK_AUTH_CUSTOM_ORG (tool output) shows the runtime check: for every document the framework reads your custom field and performs an AUTHORITY-CHECK on object EDO_ORG. Documents that fail the check are removed from the result list before the UI receives it.\n\n4. Add the restriction to business roles.  \n   \u2022 App \u201cMaintain Business Roles\u201d (F2541) \u2192 Restrictions tab \u2192 select EDO_ORG and enter allowed values (1010, 2020 \u2026).  \n   \u2022 Users assigned to the role will see only the eDocuments whose custom field value matches their authorised list.\n\n5. Result at runtime  \n   \u2022 List page in F4306/F1048 shows only the documents for which the logged-on user has authorisation; deep-links to other documents also fail the authorisation check.\n\nPlain-language summary  \nCreate a custom \u201corganisation unit\u201d field, populate it when the eDocument is generated, and assign the delivered restriction type EDO_ORG to business roles\u2014the apps will automatically hide any eDocuments whose custom-field value the user is not authorised to see.",

    "generated_answer": "Technical answer  \nYes. In SAP S/4HANA Public Cloud you can stop (suppress) the automatic creation of an eDocument before it ever appears in the \u201cManage Electronic Documents\u201d or the \u201ceDocument Cockpit\u201d apps by implementing the cloud BAdI:\n\nBAdI ID\u2003\u2003\u2003: EDOC_CHECK_E_DOCUMENT_CREATION  \nBusiness context: Electronic Document (FINS_EDOCUMENT)  \nChanging field : CV_SUPPRESS_EDOC  ( \u2018X\u2019 \u2192 no eDocument is written)\n\nHow it works  \n1. The standard framework checks the activation tables (company code, source-type, document type).  \n2. If the document is technically in scope, the BAdI is called.  \n3. Your custom ABAP logic sets CV_SUPPRESS_EDOC = abap_true when the conditions you define are met (e.g. billing type = ZPRF, amount < EUR 100, customer lacks GLN/Peppol ID, etc.).  \n4. When the flag is true, no entry is inserted in EDOC_HEADER; therefore the document never shows up in the two Fiori apps.\n\nMinimal implementation example (created in Fiori app \u201cCustom Logic\u201d):\n\n```\nMETHOD edoc_check_e_document_creation.\n  \"Skip if receiver is not Peppol-registered\n  DATA lv_gln TYPE bu_identification.\n  SELECT SINGLE idnumber\n         INTO lv_gln\n         FROM but0id\n         WHERE partner = is_header_data-bp_number\n           AND type    = 'GLN'.\n\n  IF lv_gln IS INITIAL.\n    cv_suppress_edoc = abap_true.\n  ENDIF.\nENDMETHOD.\n```\n\nPrerequisites  \n\u2022 SSCUIs \u201cActivate Source Type Documents for Company Code\u201d and \u201cAssign eDocument Type to \u2026\u201d must still be set so the framework reaches the BAdI.  \n\u2022 Implementation is transported via the standard Cloud transport process.\n\nResult  \nOnly source documents that pass your custom check receive an eDocument; all others are silently ignored and will not clutter the cockpit or run through transmission.\n\nPlain-language summary  \nYes\u2014you can build a small Custom Logic extension that tells the system \u201cdon\u2019t create an e-invoice when my special rules apply,\u201d so the document never appears in the electronic-document apps.",

Locate the extensibility hook  \n   \u2022 Enhancement spot ES_EDOCUMENT_CLOUD  \n   \u2022 BAdI EDOC_ADAPTOR_CLOUD  (\u201cEnhancements for the Processing of eDocuments\u201d)  \n     \u2013 The same BAdI is exposed to key users in the Fiori \u201cCustom Logic\u201d app under business context \u201ceDocument \u2013 Modify final invoice XML\u201d.\n\n2. Create the enhancement implementation  \n   a. Open ABAP Development Tools (ADT) or the Custom Logic app.  \n   b. Add a new enhancement implementation for EDOC_ADAPTOR_CLOUD.  \n   c. Maintain the mandatory filter values delivered by SAP (Country = \u2018IN\u2019, Generic_Filter = \u2018IN_GSTR\u2019 \u2013 they are technically ignored for Greece but must stay unchanged).\n\n3. Implement the XML-manipulation method  \n   Implement interface IF_EDOC_ADAPTOR_CLOUD, most often method MODIFY_COMPLETE_XML (called after standard mapping, before the XML is handed to SAP Integration Suite). Typical pattern:\n\n```\nMETHOD if_edoc_adaptor_cloud~modify_complete_xml.\n  DATA(lo_xml) = me->convert_string_to_xml( is_edoc-xml ).\n  \"Add or overwrite nodes\n  DATA(lo_node) = lo_xml->find_node( '/Invoice/\u2026' ).\n  IF lo_node IS INITIAL.\n      lo_node = lo_xml->create_node( \u2026 ).\n      lo_node->set_value( \u2018NEW_VALUE\u2019 ).\n  ENDIF.\n\n  \"Optional consistency check\n  IF lo_xml->find_node( '/Invoice/DocHeader/InvoiceValue' ) IS INITIAL.\n      RAISE EXCEPTION TYPE cx_edoc_badi\n        EXPORTING textid = cx_edoc_badi=>missing_data.\n  ENDIF.\n\n  es_xml_out = lo_xml->serialize( ).\nENDMETHOD.\n```\n\n4. Activate and transport (if required).\n\n5. Test and monitor  \n   \u2022 Generate an invoice, open it in Manage Electronic Documents / eDocument Cockpit, and choose \u201cDownload XML\u201d to verify changes.  \n   \u2022 If your BAdI raises an error the status becomes \u201cRejected by BAdI\u201d; correct data and press \u201cResubmit\u201d.  \n   \u2022 Use AIF Monitor (/AIF/IFMON) for payload tracing.\n\n6. Runtime flow  \n   Enhanced XML \u2192 AIF mapping completed \u2192 SAP Integration Suite iFlow \u201cDocument & Reporting Compliance: Greece\u201d \u2192 myDATA \u2192 response (UID, MARK) returned and updated in cockpit.\n\nThe two SAP-source extracts (sap_documentation_summary & sap_help_lookup) both confirm that EDOC_ADAPTOR_CLOUD is the dedicated public-cloud hook and outline the identical steps above; no discrepancies were found.\n\nPlain-language takeaway  \nCreate a small BAdI implementation (EDOC_ADAPTOR_CLOUD) in the Custom Logic app or ADT, adjust the XML in method MODIFY_COMPLETE_XML, activate it, and your invoices in the Manage Electronic Documents app will carry the new or corrected XML tags required for Greece myDATA.",

    "generated_answer": "Technical answer  \nYes \u2013 in SAP S/4HANA Cloud, public edition, you can enrich an outbound e-mail with extra attachments, but only by implementing the released BAdI EDOC_PART_CONN_CHANGE_EMAIL_V2 (enhancement spot ES_EDOCUMENT_CLOUD).  \n\u2022 Inside method CHANGE_EMAIL_TO_CUSTOMER you receive the changing table ATTACHMENTS.  \n\u2022 For every additional file insert one line (or several 255-character lines for large content) and fill at least:  \n  \u2013 ATTACHM_TYPE\u2003(\u2018PDF\u2019, \u2018XML\u2019, \u2018TXT\u2019 \u2026)  \n  \u2013 ATTACHM_SUBJECT\u2003(filename shown to the recipient)  \n  \u2013 CONTENT_HEX or CONTENT_TEXT\u2003(file body broken into \u2264255-byte chunks)  \n  \u2013 ATTACHM_HEADER\u2003(optional MIME header lines, also \u2264255 bytes each)  \n\u2022 Activate and transport the enhancement. When the DRC e-mail is triggered (e.g. German XRechnung, PL KSeF, SA eInvoice, TH eTax), the additional files are merged into the mail together with the standard PDF.  \nNo SSCUI or form-template setting alone can add files; the BAdI is the only released mechanism in the public cloud. For \u201cclassical\u201d SD/FI output e-mails (not handled by DRC) SAP has not yet released an equivalent hook, so extra attachments are currently not supported there.\n\nExample snippet inside CHANGE_EMAIL_TO_CUSTOMER  \n```\nDATA ls_attach TYPE edoc_ca_email_attach.\nls_attach-attachm_type     = 'XML'.\nls_attach-attachm_subject  = |Invoice_{ iv_edoc_id }.xml|.\nls_attach-content_hex      = VALUE edoc_ca_content_hex_t( ( line = lv_xml_line ) ... ).\nAPPEND ls_attach TO attachments.\n```\n\nPlain-language summary  \nYou can attach extra files to customer e-mails in S/4HANA Cloud, but you must use the provided eDocument BAdI; there is no point-and-click setting for it yet.",

Model the new eDocument process  \n   \u2013 List the business states you need (CREATED, SUBMIT_REQ, SENT, \u2026) and the allowed status transitions.  \n   \u2013 Decide which actions will move the document from one status to the next (CREATE_FROM_HOOK, SUBMIT, SEND_TO_CUST, GET_STATUS, CANCEL, etc.).\n\n3. Configure the process \u2013 Fiori app \u201ceDocument Process Manager\u201d  \n   a. Create Process ID; assign source document type (e.g. SD billing) and country/region.  \n   b. Maintain Status Catalog.  \n   c. Maintain Action Catalog; for each action define the \u201cNext Status\u201d and, if required, the implementation class that will run.  \n   d. Transport the configuration with CBC transport tools.\n\n4. Implement ABAP action logic (Developer Extensibility)  \n   \u2022 Create an enhancement for released BAdI EDOC_PROCESSING_ACTION (one class per action).  \n   \u2022 Main method IF_EDOC_ACTION~EXECUTE( ):  \n        \u2013 Read eDocument via API_CL_EDOCUMENT=>GET_DOCUMENT  \n        \u2013 Build XML (or call mapping service) and store in EDOCFILE  \n        \u2013 Call outbound proxy / REST client to Integration Suite endpoint  \n        \u2013 Persist external track-ID, update status with IF_EDOC_UPDATE=>SET_STATUS( ).  \n   \u2022 Keep EXECUTE idempotent so that a repeated SUBMIT does not send duplicates.\n\n5. Automatic creation (\u201chook\u201d) from the source transaction  \n   \u2022 Implement BAdI EDOC_GENERATION_HOOK for the relevant application (e.g. billing-document creation).  \n   \u2022 Call CL_EDOC_CREATOR=>CREATE_FROM_SOURCE( ) to instantiate the eDocument in status CREATED.\n\n6.

Communication arrangements  \n   \u2022 Create outbound communication arrangement (e.g. SOAP service group SAP_COM_0540 or your custom service), maintain URL, OAuth/Basic credentials, and reference it in the SUBMIT action definition.\n\n8. Testing & monitoring  \n   \u2022 Use app \u201cManage Electronic Documents (F1675)\u201d to follow the status log, view stored XML, and manually trigger actions.  \n   \u2022 Payload files sit in table EDOCFILE; status history in EDOC_STATUS.  \n   \u2022 Use \u201cRestrict Source-Document Cancellation\u201d app to block reversal of billing docs until the eInvoice is accepted.  \n\n9.

    "generated_answer": "Technical explanation (step-by-step)  \nThe public-cloud stack (SAP S/4HANA Cloud, public edition) does not use transaction SOAMANAGER.  \nInstead you build and bind the SOAP consumer proxy to Document & Reporting Compliance (DRC) entirely with the \u201cCommunication Management\u201d objects that are delivered in-app and with ADT (ABAP Development Tools).\n\n1. Download the WSDL of the DRC cloud-edition service  \n   \u2022 In the DRC cockpit (BTP tenant) open Process \u25ba Integration \u25ba Download WSDL.  \n   \u2022 Save the file locally; it will be imported in the next step.\n\n2. Generate the ABAP consumer proxy (Service Consumption Model)  \n   \u2022 In ADT: File \u25ba New \u25ba Other ABAP Repository Object \u25ba Connectivity \u25ba Service Consumption Model.  \n   \u2022 Select \u201cWeb Service\u201d and upload the WSDL.  \n   \u2022 Activate. ADT creates, for example, class ZCO_EDO_<process>_SVC and all DDIC types.\n\n3. Create an Outbound Service that wraps the proxy  \n   \u2022 ADT: New \u25ba Cloud Communication Management \u25ba Outbound Service.  \n   \u2022 Service Type = SOAP.  \n   \u2022 Service Interface = the proxy class ZCO_\u2026 created in step 2.  \n   \u2022 Keep the proposed service ID (e.g. OS_EDO_<process>). Activate.\n\n4. Embed the Outbound Service in a Communication Scenario  \n   \u2022 ADT: New \u25ba Cloud Communication Management \u25ba Communication Scenario.  \n   \u2022 Add the Outbound Service created in step 3.  \n   \u2022 Release/Publish the scenario (e.g. ZSC_EDO_<process>). Transport if required.\n\n5. In-app configuration (key user, no ADT)  \n   a. Create Communication System  \n      \u2022 App \u201cCommunication Systems\u201d \u2192 New.  \n      \u2022 Host name = HTTPS endpoint shown in the WSDL (your BTP sub-account URL).  \n      \u2022 Add a user or choose OAuth 2.0 as requested by the DRC help page.  \n   b. Create Communication Arrangement  \n      \u2022 App \u201cCommunication Arrangements\u201d \u2192 New.  \n      \u2022 Choose the scenario ZSC_EDO_<process>.  \n      \u2022 Assign the Communication System from 5-a, maintain user / client-certificate.  \n      \u2022 Save; the arrangement now stores URL, credentials, and generates a technical destination ID.\n\n6. Call the proxy at runtime (example)  \n   DATA(lo_dest) = cl_soap_destination_provider=>create_by_comm_arrangement(  \n                     comm_scenario  = 'ZSC_EDO_<process>' ).  \n   DATA(lo_proxy) = NEW zco_edo_<process>_svc( destination = lo_dest ).  \n   DATA(ls_req)   = VALUE zsc_req_msg_type( \u2026 ).  \n   lo_proxy->submit_document( EXPORTING input = ls_req  \n                              IMPORTING output = ls_resp ).\n\n7. Test the setup  \n   \u2022 From the Communication Arrangement press \u201cCheck Connection\u201d.  \n   \u2022 In EDOC_COCKPIT submit a test eDocument; the call uses the proxy and the destination created above.  \n   \u2022 Monitor with the \u201cSOAP Message Monitor\u201d Fiori app.\n\nResult: you have a new process in DRC whose backend proxy is fully configured without SOAMANAGER, using the public-cloud communication objects that are released for customers.\n\nPlain-language summary  \nDownload the DRC WSDL, import it in ADT to generate a consumer proxy, wrap that proxy in an Outbound Service, expose the service in a Communication Scenario, and finish the wiring with a Communication System + Arrangement in the S/4HANA Cloud UI; after that the proxy can be called directly from your ABAP code or by the eDocument cockpit.",

    "generated_answer": "Technical explanation \u2013 creating a brand-new DRC \u201cProcess\u201d for an Italian customer in SAP S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition relies on two delivered extensibility pillars that SAP calls \u201cfoundation layer\u201d and \u201ccountry adapters\u201d (tool output #1).  \nAll configuration is done with CBC/SSCUIs and Fiori apps; there is no SAP GUI customizing in Public Cloud.  \nBelow is a step-by-step cookbook that combines the generic process-creation steps (tool output #2) with the Italy-specific extensibility points (tool output #1).\n\n1. Prerequisites & activation  \n   a. In Central Business Configuration (CBC) add scope item 5XU \u201cDocument and Reporting Compliance\u201d.  \n   b. Activate feature GSLOGGEN_EDC_FT2502_1 in Configure Your Solution \u2192 \u201cActivate Features\u201d.  \n   c. Assign business catalog SAP_SD_BC_GLO_EDC (generic) plus the Italian DRC catalog (contains CA-GTF-CSC-EDO-IT tiles) to the implementation user.  \n   d. Run task list SAP_FIORI_FCM_CONTENT_ACTIVATION so that the new tiles appear.\n\n2. Create the electronic-document skeleton (\u201cDefine Interface Type for eDocument\u201d SSCUI)  \n   \u2022 Choose \u201cNew Entries\u201d, give the interface a key (e.g. ITPO), set country = IT, process category = 30 (eInvoice) or 40 (ePurchaseOrder) as relevant.  \n   \u2022 Specify the \u201cProcess Manager\u201d micro-service as runtime.  \n   \u2022 Save and transport.\n\n3. Define the eDocument type & basic mapping  \n   \u2022 SSCUI \u201cAssign eDocument Type to Accounting Document Type\u201d \u2192 map ITPO to SD billing types or FI document types you need.  \n   \u2022 SSCUI \u201cMaintain General Parameters for eDocument\u201d \u2192 point to the Communication Arrangement for AIF/CPI iflow that you will build in step 7.  \n   \u2022 SSCUI \u201cActivate Source Type Documents for Company Code\u201d \u2192 tick the Italian company codes.\n\n4. Add Italy-specific data fields (extensibility)  \n   \u2022 CUP/CIG codes required for Italian public-tender purchase orders are not part of the standard eInvoice schema.  \n   \u2022 Use Key-User Extensibility \u2192 \u201cCustom Fields & Logic\u201d:  \n     \u2013 Business Context = \u201cProcurement: Purchasing Document Item (MM)\u201d (structure EKPODATA, table EKPO \u2013 tool output #1).  \n     \u2013 Create two fields: \u201cCUP_Code\u201d and \u201cCIG_Code\u201d; mark them as relevant for OData services.  \n   \u2022 In the same app create a UI adaptation to expose the fields on the \u201cItaly\u201d tab of the Purchase Order Fiori app (tool output #1 confirms they belong there).\n\n5. Map the new fields into the XML payload  \n   \u2022 BAdI SD_EDOC_XML_ENHANCE or FI_EDOC_XML_ENHANCE (depending on process) \u2013 available in Public Cloud for field enhancement.  \n   \u2022 Sample implementation: read extensions CUP_Code/CIG_Code from EKPO and place them into the correct XML node for SDI (Servizio Di Intercambio) or Peppol BIS.\n\n6. Optional \u2013 payment medium or other file-level adaptations  \n   \u2022 If the process outputs a payment file, enhance delivered formats (CUP/CIG capable) via BAdI FIN_PAYMEDIUM_GENERATION (tool output #1).\n\n7. Build / copy the CPI iFlow  \n   \u2022 Copy SAP\u2019s reference iFlow for Italy (package \u201cSAP Document and Reporting Compliance, Italy\u201d) into the customer namespace.  \n   \u2022 Add mapping steps for CUP/CIG if required or for any other custom elements.  \n   \u2022 Deploy and note the endpoint URL and user.\n\n8. Connect the iFlow to Process Manager  \n   \u2022 SSCUI \u201cDefine Process Communication Through Cloud Services\u201d: create an entry that points the interface type ITPO to the CPI endpoint credentials.  \n   \u2022 Activate Additional eDocument Instance Creation (if process needs multiple outputs).\n\n9. Model internal approval / consistency workflow  \n   \u2022 Open Fiori app \u201cManage Workflows\u201d (App ID F8647).  \n   \u2022 Create workflow, scenario = \u201cElectronic Document Consistency\u201d.  \n   \u2022 Start condition: Company Code = IT**, eDocument Type = ITPO.  \n   \u2022 Add approval steps, choose teams via \u201cDetermine Approver from Responsibility Management\u201d.  \n   \u2022 Activate the version.\n\n10. Value mappings (only if codes differ from SAP default)  \n    \u2022 In Fiori app \u201cManage Your Solution\u201d open SSCUI \u201cDefine Value Mapping\u201d.  \n    \u2022 Typical Italian objects: INVOICE_TYPE_CODE_SD, PAYMENT_MEANS_CODE, TAX_CATEGORY.\n\n11. Test and transport  \n    \u2022 Use \u201ceDocument Cockpit\u201d to create a test invoice/PO, trigger conversion, review XML, send to SDI test endpoint.  \n    \u2022 Move CBC configuration and workflow to Q and P via standard 3-system transport.\n\n12. Go-live housekeeping  \n    \u2022 Schedule job \u201ceDocument: Processing in Background\u201d.  \n    \u2022 Monitor integration in \u201cApplication Integration\u201d (CPI) and \u201ceDocument Cockpit\u201d.\n\nPlain-language summary  \nSwitch on scope item 5XU, define a new Italian eDocument interface and type in CBC, add any Italian-specific fields (like CUP/CIG) through the Custom Fields app, map them into the XML with the public-cloud BAdIs, link a copied CPI iFlow to Process Manager, build an approval workflow in the \u201cManage Workflows\u201d Fiori tile, test in the eDocument Cockpit, and transport to production.",

    "generated_answer": "Technical explanation  \nYes. In SAP S/4HANA Cloud, public edition you can create your own persistence that a new Document & Reporting Compliance (DRC) country process can consume. Because classic SE11 tables are not allowed in the public cloud, you have two supported paths:\n\n1. Key-user extensibility \u2013 Fiori app \u201cCustom Business Objects\u201d  \n   \u2022 Creates YY1_* tables and an accompanying CDS entity automatically.  \n   \u2022 No ABAP coding or ADT needed; objects are transported with Software Collections.  \n   \u2022 The generated table or CDS entity appears in the DRC Query Designer under \u201cDatabase Table/View\u201d or \u201cCDS View/CDS Entity\u201d, so you can point your new statutory report query to it.\n\n2. Developer extensibility (Embedded Steampunk / ABAP Cloud)  \n   \u2022 In ADT you define a CDS TABLE ENTITY or classic Dictionary table in the customer namespace (Z*).  \n   \u2022 Mark it with release contract C1 so that key-user tools and DRC can read it.  \n   \u2022 After activation the table (or a CDS view entity you add on top) is selectable in the DRC Query Designer exactly like an SAP-delivered object.\n\nImportant notes taken from SAP documentation  \n\u2022 \u201cIn SAP S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition you cannot use classic SE11; persistence is provided either by CDS TABLE ENTITY (developer extensibility) or by Custom Business Objects.\u201d (sap_help_lookup)  \n\u2022 \u201cCustom data persistence must be created before you build the DRC Query; the Query tool itself cannot create tables.\u201d (sap_help_lookup, DRC guide extract)  \n\u2022 Security is not added automatically; if the data is sensitive create or assign the proper IAM authorizations to the table/CDS. (sap_documentation_summary)\n\nQuick example (Developer Extensibility)  \n```abap\ndefine table entity z_i_drc_trx\n  with {\n    @EndUserText.label : 'DRC \u2013 Custom Transactions'\n    key company_code : abap.abap_cukey;\n    key doc_number   : abap.char(10);\n    tax_amount       : abap.curr(17,2);\n    country_proc     : abap.char(5);\n  }\n```\nActivate, transport, then in Define Statutory Reports \u2192 Queries choose Data Source = \u201cCDS View/CDS Entity\u201d \u2192 Z_I_DRC_TRX.\n\nQuick example (Key-user)  \nCustom Business Object \u201cYY1_VATINTRASTAT\u201d \u2192 Publish.  \nSystem creates table YY1_VATINTRASTAT. In DRC Query Designer select Data Source = \u201cDatabase Table/View\u201d \u2192 YY1_VATINTRASTAT.\n\nPlain-language summary  \nYou can create your own table in the public-cloud system for a new DRC country scenario\u2014either through the Custom Business Objects app or, for developers, via a CDS table entity in ABAP Cloud\u2014and then point your DRC query to that table.",

Here's why:\n\n1. Accuracy: The answer correctly states that it is possible to develop an ABAP class for DRC Process mapping in Public Cloud using DRC extensibility features. This is confirmed by both the expert answer and the sap_documentation_summary tool output, which mentions Developer Extensibility features in SAP S/4HANA Cloud.\n\n2. Completeness: The answer provides a comprehensive explanation of how to create a process-level mapping ABAP class, including two main scenarios (building a new electronic-document process and extending an SAP-delivered process). It also explains the key public-cloud constraints, which is valuable information not mentioned in the expert answer.\n\n3. Technical Details: The answer includes specific technical information, such as the class naming convention (YY1_CL_EDOC_MAP_<name>), the interfaces to implement (IF_EDOCUMENT_MAPPING, IF_EDOCUMENT_FACTORY, IF_EDOCUMENT_VALIDATION), and the BAdIs to use (EDOCUMENT_PROCESS_ENHANCE, EDOCUMENT_SUBMIT_ENHANCE). This level of detail goes beyond the expert answer and is supported by the abap_method_codebase_search tool results, which show similar class structures and method implementations.\n\n4. Code Example: The answer provides a small code snippet demonstrating how to define and implement the custom ABAP class, which is helpful for practical implementation.\n\n5. Public Cloud Specifics: The answer correctly emphasizes the public cloud constraints, such as using only released ABAP APIs, avoiding direct table updates, and following the YY1_* namespace. This information is crucial for development in the public cloud environment and aligns with the extensibility features mentioned in the sap_documentation_summary tool output.\n\nIn conclusion, the generated answer not only fully addresses the question but also provides additional valuable information and practical guidance for implementing DRC Process mapping in SAP Public Cloud using ABAP classes and extensibility features.",

In SAP S/4HANA Cloud, public edition you can create your own ABAP class to perform \u201cprocess mapping\u201d for Document and Reporting Compliance (DRC) by using the framework\u2019s released developer-extensibility objects (sap_help_lookup output). Two main scenarios exist:\n\nA. Build an entirely new electronic-document process  \n 1. In ADT (3-system cloud landscape) create class YY1_CL_EDOC_MAP_<name> that implements released interface IF_EDOCUMENT_MAPPING.  \n 2. (Usually together with) a factory class implementing IF_EDOCUMENT_FACTORY and \u2013 if needed \u2013 a validation class implementing IF_EDOCUMENT_VALIDATION.  \n 3. Register the classes in SSCUI \u201cDefine eDocument Types & Implementations\u201d so the framework calls them when it converts the EDOCUMENT* tables into the required UBL/Peppol or local XSD structure.  \n 4. Transport with Cloud TMS; test in \u201cManage Electronic Documents\u201d.\n\nB. Extend an SAP-delivered process  \n \u2022 Implement BAdI EDOCUMENT_PROCESS_ENHANCE or EDOCUMENT_SUBMIT_ENHANCE inside enhancement spot ES_EDOCUMENT with your custom class (e.g. YY1_BADI_EDOC_EXT).  \n \u2022 The BAdI lets you change or add fields in the XML without replacing the entire mapping class.  \n \u2022 Activate the implementation in the \u201cCustom Logic\u201d Fiori app or ADT.\n\nKey public-cloud constraints  \n \u2022 Only released ABAP APIs (IF_*, CDS views beginning YY1_*) are permitted.  \n \u2022 No direct table updates\u2014use the provided interfaces.  \n \u2022 All configuration is done via CBC/SSCUIs; no SPRO.  \n \u2022 Follow the YY1_* namespace and use a 3-system landscape for transportable developments.\n\nSmall code snippet (ADT)  \n\nCLASS yy1_cl_edoc_map_demo DEFINITION  \n  PUBLIC  FINAL  \n  CREATE PUBLIC .  \n  PUBLIC SECTION.  \n    INTERFACES if_edocument_mapping.   \u201cReleased interface  \nENDCLASS.  \n\nCLASS yy1_cl_edoc_map_demo IMPLEMENTATION.  \n  METHOD if_edocument_mapping~map_to_xml.  \n    \" your mapping logic \u2013 fill cv_xml_data from is_edoc_header / it_edoc_item  \n  ENDMETHOD.  \nENDCLASS.\n\nPlain-language summary  \nYou are allowed to write your own ABAP mapping class in the S/4HANA public cloud; just implement the released DRC interfaces or BAdIs, register the class in the provided SSCUIs, and stay within the public-cloud extensibility rules.",

Cockpit & metering  \n   \u2022 The eDocument Type determines which columns and custom fields appear in the eDocument Cockpit and how authorisations are checked.  \n   \u2022 Processed-document counters and licensing in the cloud edition are stored per eDocument Type.\n\nBecause every subsequent configuration node (mapping to SD/FI/CI doc types, communication definition, BAdI filters, cockpit UI extensions) requires the key field \u201ceDocument Type\u201d, the very first step in DRC extensibility for a new scenario is: SPRO \u2192 Financial Accounting \u2192 Document Compliance \u2192 Framework Settings \u2192 Define eDocument Types.\n\nExample in practice  \n1. Create eDocument Type NEW_ENINV (Electronic Energy Invoice).  \n2. Map SD billing type ZEEI to NEW_ENINV.  \n3. Maintain company code 1000 / NEW_ENINV / Cloud Edition in \u201cDefine Process Communication\u2026\u201d.  \n4. Implement BAdI EDOC_OUTPUT_DERIVE (filter NEW_ENINV) to build the UBL payload.  \nWhen ZEEI is posted, framework finds the mapping, creates an eDocument of type NEW_ENINV, calls your BAdIs, and sends it via SAP DRC Cloud.\n\nPlain-language summary  \nYou create an eDocument Type because it is the unique identifier that ties your custom compliance process to the right source documents, communication channel, enhancement logic and cockpit UI; without it the DRC framework cannot recognise or execute the new process.",

Scope activation and framework  \n   \u2022 Activate scope item 78L \u201cSAP Document and Reporting Compliance, Cloud Edition Integration\u201d.  \n   \u2022 Ensure the generic eDocument (Electronic Document Processing) framework is active; import the delivered BC-Sets and SAP Notes for the specific country/region.\n\n2. Secure connectivity to SAP Document and Reporting Compliance, cloud edition  \n   \u2022 Create a communication system \u2192 communication arrangement that points to your DRC cloud-edition tenant (service SAP_COM_1019 or country-specific service).  \n   \u2022 Select an authentication type (OAuth 2.0 client credentials or basic) and store the technical user.  \n   \u2022 Download the server-root certificate of the DRC endpoint and add it to the Certificate Trust List (STRUST) so ABAP trusts the HTTPS call.  \n   \u2022 Maintain the tenant ID and access key obtained during the DRC onboarding wizard in view /EDOCUMENT/DRCSYS.\n\n3. HTTP / bgRFC infrastructure in the ABAP stack  \n   \u2022 Activate the required SICF node(s) that serve the inbound proxy (system automatically called by the pull report).  \n   \u2022 In transaction SBGRFCCONF define a dedicated inbound destination for the eDocument application to avoid queue name collisions.\n\n4. Optional monitoring framework  \n   \u2022 Activate SAP Application Interface Framework (AIF) channels if you prefer AIF monitoring instead of basic SLG1 logs.\n\n5. Message-type and proxy configuration  \n   \u2022 In SPRO \u2192 Cross-Application Components \u2192 SAP Document and Reporting Compliance \u2192 Inbound Processing \u2192 Define Message Types:  \n     \u2013 Use the delivered message type (e.g. RO_MESSAGE_PULL for Romania, PEPPOL_IN_PULL for Peppol) or copy it for customer-specific logic.  \n   \u2022 In SOA Manager create logical ports for the proxy ElectronicDocument_Inbound_Process that point to the DRC HTTPS URL.\n\n6. Scheduling / user interface  \n   \u2022 Schedule background job /EDOCUMENT/PROC_INBOUND (or use the Fiori tile \u201cProcessing Inbound Messages\u201d) to pull documents at the desired interval.  \n   \u2022 Grant users catalog SAP_FIN_BC_EDOC_PROC_PC (or role that contains it) so they can run the app and monitor documents in Manage Electronic Documents (or EDOC_COCKPIT).  \n\nWith the above in place the runtime flow is: external system \u2192 DRC cloud edition (message parked) \u2192 scheduled pull from S/4HANA PCE \u2192 document saved in tables EDOC_IN_HDR/ITM \u2192 displayed in EDOC_COCKPIT and optionally posted to MM/FI.\n\nPlain-language summary  \nSwitch on scope item 78L, connect your S/4HANA private-cloud system securely to SAP\u2019s Document and Reporting Compliance service, trust its certificate, define the inbound message type and proxies, and schedule the pull job\u2014then the system can fetch and process documents that external platforms send to SAP.",

Where to enhance  \n   \u2022 Use enhancement spot EDOC_ADAPTOR \u2013 method SET_OUTPUT_DATA.  \n     (In Private Cloud you still have SE18/SE19 and can create a classic BAdI implementation.)  \n   \u2022 If your country/format delivers a dedicated \u201c \u2026FILL_XML_FILE \u201d BAdI (e.g. IF_EDOC_EU_XML_INVOICE~FILL_XML_FILE for Peppol, IF_EDOC_IT_XML_FILE~FILL_XML_FILE for Italy), implement that instead; it is called immediately after SET_OUTPUT_DATA and offers the same modifiable XML structure.\n\n2. Runtime sequence  \n   \u2013 The standard framework builds the electronic document, produces the legal XML and then calls your BAdI.  \n   \u2013 You receive two parameters: XML_FILE (original) and XML_FILE_MODIFIED (changing).  \n   \u2013 Add one \u201cadditional document reference\u201d line per file you want to embed and return XML_FILE_MODIFIED.  \n   \u2013 The cockpit stores the enriched XML and later sends it to the authority / your customer.\n\n3.

In your ABAP project, go to the enhancement spot ES_EDOCUMENT (path: package GLO-EDO > Enhancements > Enhancement Spots).\n2. Right-click ES_EDOCUMENT_CLOUD and select New BAdI Enhancement Implementation .\n3. Enter a package, name, and description for the implementation.\n4. Choose Add BAdI Implementation and select EDOC_ADAPTOR.\n5. (Optional) Create a BAdI filter for Country and/or Generic Filter.\n6. Choose Implementing Class to create a new implementation class. The new implementation class automatically implements the interfaces if_badi_interfaces and if_edoc_adaptor_cloud.\n7. After generating the class, open the interface method and press F3 to view its parameters. To display the documentation, press F2.\n8. Implement the necessary logic in the method to modify the XML tags and fill optional XML tags with values such as customer material number or delivery number.\n9. Activate your BAdI implementation. When you display the XML file of the electronic document in the eDocument Cockpit or Manage Electronic Documents app, you will see that the relevant XML tags are now filled with the desired values.

In SAP S/4HANA Private Cloud you can enhance the standard \u201ceDocument \u2013 Customer Invoice (Italy)\u201d process that feeds the Italian SDI (Sistema di Interscambio).  SAP exposes the same extensibility layer for Italy that is already used in other countries, and it is fully available in a Private-Cloud three-system landscape.\n\nHow you extend it  \n1. Key-user (in-place) extensions  \n   \u2022 Fiori app \u201cCustom Logic\u201d (F1481) \u2192 Business context \u201cDocument Compliance\u201d or \u201ceDocument: Italy\u201d.  \n   \u2022 Implement one of the predefined BAdIs, for example  \n     \u2013 EDOC_IT_XML_MODIFY (modify/enrich any XML node before submission)  \n     \u2013 CHECK_IF_EDOCUMENT_HAS_TO_BE_CREATED (suppress creation for pro-forma, self-billing, etc.).  \n   \u2022 ABAP code is stored and activated locally\u2014no transports are required.\n\n2. Developer extensions  \n   \u2022 Eclipse/ADT \u2192 enhancement spot ES_EDOCUMENT.  \n   \u2022 Create classical BAdI class (e.g. ZCL_EDOC_IT_MYEXT) or DDIC appends to EDOC_ITEM / EDOC_HEADER.  \n   \u2022 Transport with gCTS through the normal DEV\u2013Q\u2013PRD track.\n\n3.

In SAP S/4HANA Private Cloud you can restrict which electronic documents appear in the eDocument Cockpit (Manage Electronic Documents app) by using the in-app extensibility delivered with Document & Reporting Compliance (DRC):\n\n1. Create a custom field  \n   \u2022 Launchpad \u2192 App \u201cCustom Fields\u201d (F1481)  \n   \u2022 Business Context = \u201cDocument Compliance\u201d  \n   \u2022 Example: YY1_ORGUNIT_EDOC (type Association to Sales Office).\n\n2.

Expose the field in the UI / filter bar  \n   \u2022 Same Custom Logic app \u2192 BAdI EDOC_CUSTOM_FIELDS_UI_CLOUD  \n   \u2022 Mark the field as displayable and searchable so users see the column and can filter by it.\n\n4. Link the field to authorisation  \n   A. Extend or copy authorisation object F_EDOC_PROC (e.g. Z_EDOC_PROC) and add the new field YY1_ORGUNIT_EDOC.  \n   B. Add the object to the PFCG / Business Role of cockpit users and maintain the allowed values (e.g. Sales Office 1000 only).  \n   C. If finer checks are needed, implement BAdI EDOC_AUTH_CHECK_CLOUD and perform an AUTHORITY-CHECK on YY1_ORGUNIT_EDOC.\n\n5. Result  \n   When a user opens the cockpit, the CDS view I_EDOCUMENTEXT supplies the custom field; the authorisation framework (or BAdI) filters out all electronic documents whose YY1_ORGUNIT_EDOC value is not authorised for that user.\n\nCode snippet examples  \n\nMETHOD if_edoc_custom_fields_cloud~fill_custom_fields.  \n  SELECT SINGLE vkbur               \"sales office  \n         FROM vbrk                  \"billing header  \n         WHERE vbeln = is_source_doc-bill_no  \n         INTO es_custom_fields-yy1_orgunit_edoc.  \nENDMETHOD.  \n\nMETHOD if_edoc_custom_fields_ui_cloud~define_custom_fields.  \n  APPEND VALUE #( fieldname = 'YY1_ORGUNIT_EDOC'  \n                  label     = 'Org.

    "generated_answer": "Technical explanation  \nThe Electronic Document Processing (EDP) framework in SAP S/4HANA Cloud, public edition lets you plug-in your own country- or business-specific \u201cprocess\u201d (invoice, credit note, delivery note, etc.) by combining three things:  \n1. ABAP enhancement (classes + BAdIs) that hold the business logic.  \n2. A configuration object called \u201ceDocument Process\u201d that orchestrates all steps, flags, statuses, and cockpit buttons.  \n3. Integration services on SAP BTP (AIF, Cloud Integration, Peppol Exchange, \u2026) for the outbound or inbound flow.\n\nEnd-to-end development steps  \n\n1. Prerequisites  \n   \u2022 Have the SAP Document and Reporting Compliance scope item and SAP Integration Suite tenant.  \n   \u2022 Work in the 3-system developer tenant with ABAP Development Tools (ADT).  \n\n2. Create or reuse an eDocument Type  \n   Fiori app \u201cManage eDocument Type\u201d \u2013 links the source document (e.g. FI invoice) to your future process.\n\n3. Build the ABAP handler class  \n   \u2022 Create ZCL_EDOC_EXT_<CTR> that implements IF_EDOCUMENT_EXT_ES.  \n   \u2022 Provide, at minimum, methods PROCESS_CREATE / SUBMIT / GET_STATUS; add PROCESS_DELETE, PROCESS_CANCEL, etc. as required.  \n   \u2022 In each method call framework helpers (e.g. CL_EDOCUMENT_EXT_ES) to read/update header EDOCUMENT and attach XML/PDF in EDOCUMENT_FILE.  \n\n4. Implement the BAdI that tells the framework when to call your process  \n   \u2022 Enhancement Spot ES_EDOCUMENT_EXT \u2192 BAdI EDOCUMENT_BASE_EXT.  \n   \u2022 Set filter = <Your-Process-Name>.  \n   \u2022 Return handler-class name and country key so the framework instantiates your class.  \n\n5. Register the factory mapping  \n   \u2022 Add an entry in CL_EDOC_FACTORY_EXT (method CLASS_CONSTRUCTOR or customizing view) so the framework knows which handler to use for the source document type.\n\n6. (Optional) Create a country/region-specific DB table  \n   \u2022 ZEDOC_<CTR>_HDR etc. if you need additional legal fields; link it to EDOCUMENT via key GUID.\n\n7. Configure the orchestration in Fiori app \u201cManage eDocument Process\u201d  \n   a. New process NOINV, PTINVOUT, etc.  \n   b. Process Steps: at least CREATE and EMPTY; typically SUBMIT, RESUBMIT, GETSTATUS, DELETE, SENDTOCUST.  \n   c. Step Versions & Variants (CREATE|HOOK so creation is automatic).  \n   d. Status Flags (CREATED, SENT, TRACKID \u2026) \u2192 Positions 01-40.  \n   e. Flag Check & Flag Change rules to control which step can run and how status string changes.  \n   f. Cockpit Actions and their underlying steps (e.g. button \u201cSend\u201d executes SUBMIT+GETSTATUS).  \n   g. Human-readable Process Statuses and the determination table.  \n   h. Toolbar layout and final activation.\n\n8. Expose or consume the interface  \n   \u2022 Map payload in AIF or CPI iFlow; use PROCESS_SUBMIT to hand over to the endpoint and store TrackID.  \n   \u2022 Implement inbound PROCESS_GET_STATUS or PROCESS_RECEIVE to update flags when responses arrive.\n\n9. Test in \u201cManage Electronic Documents\u201d cockpit  \n   \u2022 Post a source invoice \u2192 framework calls CREATE|HOOK.  \n   \u2022 Trigger \u201cSend\u201d action \u2192 SUBMIT executed, check application log object EDOCUMENT.  \n   \u2022 Verify status changes, XML stored, and track-id returned.  \n\n10. Transport to QA and Production.  \n\nCode snippet skeleton  \n\nMETHOD if_edocument_ext_es~process_submit.  \n  DATA lt_file TYPE TABLE OF edocument_file.  \n  \"\u2026build XML\u2026\"  \n  cl_edocument_ext_es=>submit_to_aif( EXPORTING it_file = lt_file  \n                                      IMPORTING ev_trackid = lv_track ).  \n  ms_header-trackid = lv_track.  \n  modify edocument from ms_header.  \nENDMETHOD.  \n\nPlain-language takeaway  \nCreate a custom eDocument process by coding one ABAP handler class and a small BAdI, then describe every step, flag, and button in the \u201cManage eDocument Process\u201d Fiori app. Once activated, the framework automatically generates, sends, and tracks your electronic document exactly like SAP-delivered processes.",

Why the <TaxAmount currencyID> shows the plant \u201cD30\u201d\n   \u2022 The attribute currencyID that ends up in /Invoice/TaxTotal/TaxSubtotal/TaxAmount is filled in method CL_EDOC_MAP_MY\u2192FILL_TAX_TOTAL.  \n     source-code line:  \n       ls_tax_subtotal-tax_amount-base-currency_id = ms_source-bkpf-waers.  \n   \u2022 BKPF-WAERS is the document currency that the posting carries.  \n   \u2022 In your accounting document 5100000296 2024 the field BKPF-WAERS actually contains \u201cD30\u201d (your plant), not a currency such as \u201cMYR\u201d.  \n     \u2013 This can happen when accounting documents are created from a bespoke interface that wrongly moves plant (WERKS) into the currency field, or when the default currency in company code configuration (T001-WAERS) was overwritten with \u201cD30\u201d.  \n   \u2022 Because the mapping class simply copies BKPF-WAERS, \u201cD30\u201d is written to the XML attribute and Peppol validation later rejects the file.\n\n   Fix\n   a. Check the accounting document in FB03 (header \u2192 \u201cCurrency\u201d field) \u2013 it will already show \u201cD30\u201d.  \n   b.

The XML element you are looking for is  \n   <cbc:CompanyID schemeID=\"MY_TTR\"> \u2026Tourism-Tax-Reg-No\u2026 </cbc:CompanyID>  \n   and it is placed below n1:AccountingSupplierParty/Party/PartyIdentification.  \n2. During XML generation SAP Document & Reporting Compliance reads this value from table T001Z (\u201cAdditional Parameters per Company Code\u201d), **not** from the tax-number fields you maintain in OBY6.  \n3. Because you entered \u201cNA\u201d in OBY6 but left T001Z empty, the mapping rule contained in CDS view I_EDOC_MY_SUPPLIER could not find a Tourism Tax Registration Number, so the whole MY_TTR node was suppressed. The IRBM validator, however, still expected it once your company is flagged as Tourism-Tax-registered, and therefore the XML failed.  \n\nHow to fix  \n1. Customizing path (on-premise) SPRO \u2192 Financial Accounting \u2192 Financial Accounting Global Settings \u2192 Company Code \u2192 Additional Parameters  \n   or S/4HANA Cloud SSCUI 102379 \u201cMaintain Additional Parameters\u201d.  \n2. Choose your Malaysian company code \u2192 \u201cAdditional Data\u201d \u2192 New Entries.  \n3. Enter  \n    Parameter type  = MY_TTR  \n    Parameter value = your Tourism Tax Registration Number (exactly as issued by MoF).  \n4. Save and transport, then regenerate (or repost) the eDocument; the preview now shows  \n\n   \u2026  \n   <cbc:CompanyID schemeID=\"MY_TTR\">TT-12345678-01</cbc:CompanyID>  \n   \u2026  \n\n5.

    "generated_answer": "Technical explanation  \n1. Why the error is raised  \n\u2022 The Hungarian \u201cImport Invoice\u201d e-document (object type HU_INV_MM_ERS) must send the reference number of the customs form to the tax authority.  \n\u2022 The SAP-delivered mapping class CL_EDOC_MAP_HU_INV_MM_ERS\u2192method FILL_INVOICE_REFERENCE reads that value from the purchase-order header text whose Text ID is stored in view EDOINEWBCONFIG field IMPORT_TEXT_TYPE.  \n\u2022 For Hungary the delivered value of IMPORT_TEXT_TYPE is F01 (Header Text).  \n\u2022 While building the XML the framework validates the content against the XSD pattern \u201c^[A-Za-z0-9]+$\u201d. Any blank, line-feed, punctuation mark, slash, dash, etc. triggers the message  \n  \u201cSpecial characters are not allowed for reference number of customs form.\u201d  \n\n2. Why you get the error even though \u201cnothing was maintained\u201d  \n\u2022 The header text F01 in table STXL very often contains control characters (line-feed HEX 0A, carriage-return HEX 0D) that are invisible in ME22N.  \n\u2022 When the text is technically empty users sometimes press <Enter>; the result is a single CR/LF pair, which reaches the mapping class and fails the pattern check.\n\n3. How to fix / prevent  \nA. Master-data correction (recommended)  \n   \u2013 ME22N \u279c Header \u279c \u201cTexts\u201d \u279c Text ID = F01  \n   \u2013 Delete hidden line breaks, tabs, punctuation; enter the real customs-declaration number using only 0-9 / A-Z.  \n   \u2013 Save the PO and recreate the LIV document or restart \u201cSubmit to DRC\u201d.\n\nB. Automatically sanitise incoming values (if users keep making mistakes)  \n   Implement BAdI EDOC_BADI_MM (EnhSpot EDOC_BADI_IMPORT_INV) method CHANGE_DOCUMENT and add e.g.  \n   ```\n   TRANSLATE cs_edoc_import_hdr-cust_form_ref USING 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ0123456789'.\n   REPLACE ALL OCCURRENCES OF REGEX '[^A-Za-z0-9]' IN cs_edoc_import_hdr-cust_form_ref WITH ''.\n   ```  \n   This strips every disallowed character before the XML is generated.\n\nC. Do not supply the field at all  \n   If your business does not need the reference number, leave IMPORT_TEXT_TYPE blank in view EDOINEWBCONFIG (SM30).  \n   The mapping class then skips the field and no check is executed.\n\nQuick checklist  \n\u2611 Text ID F01 active and filled with a clean number.  \n\u2611 No CR/LF, spaces, punctuation.  \n\u2611 Copying rule MM \u279c LIV active so the text reaches MIRO.  \n\u2611 Re-run \u201cSubmit to DRC\u201d after cleaning.  \n\nPlain-language summary  \nThe e-invoice generator is pulling the customs-form number from the PO header text; invisible line breaks or symbols in that text count as \u201cspecial characters\u201d and make the XML invalid. Delete the hidden characters or let a small BAdI strip them out, then resubmit the invoice.",

SOA-MANAGER \u2192 Web-Service Configuration  \n   a. Select CO_DCS_DCP_GENERIC_WEBSERVICE (and EDO_UBL_GENERIC_WEBSERVICE if UBL is used).  \n   b. Check that the logical port currently set to \u201cPREVIEW\u201d contains the exact Peppol Exchange preview URL shown above. Correct it if necessary and activate.  \n\n2. Certificates  \n   a. Verify that the client certificate stored in SOA-MANAGER for that logical port is identical to the certificate uploaded in BTP Peppol Exchange \u2192 Connection Management.  \n   b. If in doubt, delete it in Connection Management and upload the same *.p12 again, then re-import into SOA-MANAGER logical port.  \n\n3. Authorisations  \n   Make sure the backend service user mentioned in Connection Management has the SAP standard authorisation objects for eDocument (class /EDO/*) and the AIF interfaces used.  \n\n4. Corrections  \n   Implement the latest versions of SAP Notes 2440686, 2783795 and 2914302 and import the BC Set contained in 2440686. Reactivate AIF fix values (e.g. /EDUBL PRICE).  \n\n5. Retest \u201cDisplay \u2013 HTML\u201d. If the call still fails, open System Logs Monitor in BTP cockpit for the Peppol service to read the exact DCP- error code and match it with the corresponding SAP Note.  \n\nShort plain-language summary  \nThe HTML preview fails because the logical port you switched now points to an incorrect or unauthorised Peppol Exchange endpoint; correct the URL, ensure the same client certificate is active in both SOA-MANAGER and the BTP Peppol dashboard, apply the listed SAP Notes, and the \u201cDisplay \u2013 HTML\u201d button will work again.",

    "generated_answer": "Technical explanation  \n1. Why the error occurs  \n   \u2022 In SAP Document & Reporting Compliance (DRC) the combination \u201cschemeID + ID value\u201d (e.g. 9930:DE123456789) must be unique in table EDOC_PAR_IDC (company) and EDOC_PAR_IDBP (business partner).  \n   \u2022 When you try to create the same VAT-based participant for a second backend (your IS-U client or second S/4HANA client) Customizing validation stops you, because the record already exists.  \n   \u2022 The Peppol network would reject two different parties that register the same participant as well, so the check is intentional.\n\n2. Two supported ways to proceed  \n\nA. Reuse one participant, point it to several systems (\u201cone ID \u2013 many destinations\u201d)  \n   1. Keep exactly one line in \u201cAssign Party-ID Types to Companies\u201d (/EDOC/PAR_ID_CMP) that contains VAT scheme 9930 (or 9956 etc.) and the VAT number.  \n   2. In IMG choose Document & Reporting Compliance \u2192 Communication \u2192 Define Process Communication through Cloud Services (/EDOC/CLOUD_COM).  \n      \u2013 For every company code (including those that live in the IS-U client) tick \u201cActivate\u201d and assign the correct HTTP destination (SM59) that leads to its BTP sub-account.  \n      \u2013 If at runtime you must switch between destinations although the ID is the same, implement BAdI EDOC_PARTICIPANT_DET to derive the destination from e.g. logical system or client.  \n   Result: Peppol sees one participant (same VAT) but DRC can forward the document to whichever backend produced it.\n\nB. Create a second participant by using a different scheme (\u201ctwo IDs \u2013 one VAT value\u201d)  \n   1. Copy scheme 9930 (DE:VAT) into a new scheme key, e.g. VA02, in view V_EDOC_SCHEME.  \n   2. Add this new scheme in:  \n      \u2013 Assign Party-ID Types to Companies (/EDOC/PAR_ID_CMP) for the companies that run in the second client.  \n      \u2013 Assign Party-ID Types to Business Partners (/EDOC/PAR_ID_BP) so BP identification can be mapped.  \n   3. Maintain the same VAT number in BP or OBY6, but because the scheme key is different, the participant becomes \u201cVA02:DE123456789\u201d and no duplication occurs.  \n   4. Register the second participant with your access-point provider (SAP DRC cloud edition) so that both 9930:DE123456789 and VA02:DE123456789 are routable.\n\n3. Checks/transactions for troubleshooting  \n   \u2022 SE16 \u2192 EDOC_PAR_IDC / EDOC_PAR_IDBP \u2013 see existing participant entries.  \n   \u2022 EDOC_COCKPIT \u2013 open one e-document and choose \u201cTechnical Data\u201d to verify which participant and scheme were used.  \n   \u2022 BP \u2192 Identification tab \u2013 ensure only the required Identification Types are assigned.\n\nPlain-language takeaway  \nYou cannot register the exact same VAT-based Peppol participant twice; either reuse the single participant and tell DRC which system to forward to, or establish a second participant by defining a new scheme key for the same VAT number.",

It covers many important aspects that align with the information from the SAP documentation summary and troubleshooting search results.\n\nPositive aspects:\n1. The answer correctly identifies authentication issues as a primary cause, mentioning client certificate problems and OAuth 2.0 configuration for S/4HANA systems.\n2. It provides a structured approach to troubleshooting, including checks for STRUST, SOAMANAGER logical port configuration, Cloud Connector settings, and credentials in CPI or DRC.\n3. The answer includes specific steps and UI locations for performing these checks, which is helpful for users trying to resolve the issue.\n\nHowever, there are some limitations and potential improvements:\n1. The generated answer doesn't mention the possibility of an expired client certificate, which the expert answer suggests as a potential cause.\n2. It doesn't address the service binding issue mentioned in the expert answer, which could be relevant to the Peppol service.\n3. The answer could benefit from mentioning the specific SAP Notes referenced in the troubleshooting search results, such as 2376378 for service ping errors.\n4. While the generated answer provides more detailed troubleshooting steps than the expert answer, it doesn't emphasize the importance of checking the specific Peppol service being used, as mentioned in the expert answer.\n\nIn conclusion, while the generated answer is informative and provides valuable troubleshooting steps, it partially misses some key points from the expert answer and could be improved by incorporating more specific references from the SAP documentation and troubleshooting guides.",

    "generated_answer": "Technical explanation  \n1. What is happening  \n\u2022 When you trigger an eDocument in EDOC_COCKPIT or use \u201cPing Web-Service\u201d in SOAMANAGER the request is answered by the DRC / Peppol cloud endpoint with HTTP 401/403 \u2013 the backend never reaches the service because the authentication data it presents are rejected.  \n\n2. Root causes found in SAP documentation and troubleshooting guides  \n\u2022 Client-certificate authentication not in place or wrong PSE/certificate used (STRUST).  \n\u2022 OAuth 2.0 client EDOC_EU_OAUTH or equivalent not created/filled (S/4HANA only).  \n\u2022 Logical port in SOAMANAGER points to the correct URL but the \u201cAuthentication\u201d tab is still set to \u201cNone\u201d or to an outdated user/password.  \n\u2022 If Cloud Connector is used, sub-account user/Location-ID mismatch blocks the tunnel.  \n\u2022 \u201cPing Web-Service\u201d failure alone is not decisive; the real test is an end-to-end cockpit submission as per SAP Note 2376378.\n\n3. Checks and fixes (follow in the given order)  \na. STRUST  \n   \u2013 Double-click the SSL Client (Standard) PSE.  \n   \u2013 Certificate List must contain the client certificate that was uploaded to the DRC / CPI tenant. If it is missing, import it and restart ICM (SMICM \u2192 Administration \u2192 ICM \u2192 Hard reset).  \n\nb. SOAMANAGER: logical port of service EDOC_OUTBOUND_SERVICE (name can differ)  \n   \u2013 Open logical port \u2192 \u201cTransport Settings\u201d: verify URL suffix:  \n     https://<subaccount>-tmn.hana.ondemand.com/... (CPI) or  \n     https://drc-<region>.cfapps.<landscape>.hana.ondemand.com/... (DRC native)  \n   \u2013 \u201cAuthentication\u201d tab:  \n     \u2022 Certificate: choose same PSE/certificate as in STRUST, OR  \n     \u2022 OAuth 2.0: choose OAuth profile that refers to client EDOC_EU_OAUTH; if the value help is empty implement SAP Note 3289969 and redo OAuth setup.  \n\nc. Cloud Connector (if in use)  \n   \u2013 Mapping host/port must equal the host in logical port URL.  \n   \u2013 Location-ID in Cloud Connector and in DRC \u201cConnection Management\u201d app must be identical.  \n   \u2013 Sub-account user entered in Cloud Connector is a BTP cockpit user, not the DRC service user.  \n\nd. Credentials / security material in CPI or DRC  \n   \u2013 Open Security Material \u2192 check that the certificate or OAuth secret has not expired.  \n   \u2013 Re-upload if near expiry.  \n\ne. Retest  \n   \u2013 Run EDOC_COCKPIT, select an invoice, \u201cSend\u201d.  \n   \u2013 Status should move to \u201cIn Transfer\u201d and then \u201cSent to Provider\u201d.  \n   \u2013 If still 401/403 activate HTTP trace (SICF \u2192 Trace) and compare presented certificate with STRUST entry.\n\nCode/UI snippets  \n\u2022 SOAMANAGER \u2192 Service Administration \u2192 Web Service Configuration  \n  Search Pattern: *EDOC*OUTBOUND*  \n\u2022 SICF trace output should show  \n  > SSL Client certificate subject CN=<company> \u2026 OK  \n  If it shows \u201cNo Client Certificate sent\u201d you are definitely missing the mapping in SOAMANAGER.\n\nPlain-language takeaway  \nYour backend is knocking at the cloud door with the wrong key; import or point to the correct client certificate (or OAuth profile) in STRUST and SOAMANAGER, make sure Cloud Connector and URLs match, then the invoices will go through.",

    "generated_answer": "Technical explanation  \n1. What 401 means in this context  \n   \u2022 The Peppol Exchange cloud service tried to push the response XML to your SAP back-end (S/4HANA or ERP) but the HTTP call was rejected at the very first security gate (ICF) with status 401 = \u201cUnauthorized\u201d.  \n   \u2022 No application logic was reached; the call failed during authentication/authorisation.  \n2. Most frequent root causes confirmed by SAP notes and docs  \n   a) Wrong communication user or password/certificate in the Connection Management app (sap_documentation_summary [1]).  \n   b) Sub-account user was filled instead of the dedicated back-end communication user (SAP Note 2926868).  \n   c) Authentication method in BTP destination \u2260 method configured in the back-end (e.g. BasicAuth used although the service expects X.509 or OAuth2).  \n   d) Communication user exists but lacks the authorisation objects / business catalog required for Peppol inbound APIs (edp_troubleshooting_search).  \n   e) Cloud Connector host / LocationID in Connection Management don\u2019t match the Cloud Connector settings, so the request never reaches the correct ICF node (sap_documentation_summary [1]).  \n\nStep-by-step resolution  \n1. Check Connection Management (Peppol Exchange Dashboard)  \n   \u2022 \u201cUser\u201d column must contain the technical communication user created in your back-end (NOT the sub-account user).  \n   \u2022 \u201cHost\u201d and optional \u201cLocationID\u201d must be identical to what you see in Cloud Connector.  \n\n2. Check Destination in BTP cockpit  \n   \u2022 Choose the authentication method that your back-end ICF node allows:  \n     \u2013 On-premise ERP / S/4: BasicAuthentication or ClientCertificateAuthentication.  \n     \u2013 S/4HANA Public Cloud: only ClientCertificateAuthentication (Basic not supported).  \n   \u2022 For certificates: upload the PFX to the destination and map the certificate to the same communication user in SU01 (tab Digital Signatures).  \n\n3. Validate the communication user in the back-end  \n   \u2022 SU01 \u2192 assign role that contains catalog SAP_FIN_BC_EINV_API_PC (or the catalog delivered for SAP_COM_0639 Communication Arrangement).  \n   \u2022 In SICF open the Peppol inbound service path (typically /sap/bc/srt/* or /sap/peppol/*) and make sure \u201cLogon Data\u201d allows the authentication type you chose.  \n\n4. Test manually  \n   \u2022 In the back-end run transaction /IWFND/GW_CLIENT (or any REST client via Cloud Connector) \u2192 call the exact service URL with the same credentials/certificate.  \n   \u2022 If the call returns HTTP 200 the configuration is correct; afterwards re-process the document from Document Monitor.  \n\n5. If the call still fails  \n   \u2022 Activate ICM trace (SMICM \u2192 Trace Level 3) and reproduce; \u201cAuthorization:\u201d header will show whether a credential was sent.  \n   \u2022 Cross-check Cloud Connector \u2192 \u201cConnectivity Tests\u201d to be sure the mapping to the internal host is working.  \n\nShort code-like checklist  \n// Peppol \u2192 Back-end connectivity  \nDestination.Authentication     == ICF.LogonMethod  \nDestination.Certificate        \u2192 mapped to SU01 user  \nConnectionMgmt.User           == back-end comm. user  \nConnectionMgmt.Host+LocID     == Cloud Connector  \nSU01 user \u2192 role with Peppol catalog  \n\nOnce all four ticks are green, the status in Document Monitor will move from \u201cReceived by sender access point\u201d to \u201cSubmitted\u201d within the next retry cycle.\n\nPlain-language summary  \nThe 401 message shows that Peppol Exchange can reach your SAP system but the log-on fails; fix the credentials or certificate and make sure the communication user has the right authorisations, then re-send the document.",

The answer correctly identifies the need to redefine the FILL_INVOICE_TYPE_CODE method from the superclass.\n2.

KOMLFK must be part of the mapping source structure; this is the case when the eDocument is created with Source Type = \u201cSettlement Management Documents\u201d.\n3. Maintain the required mapping entries in value mapping \u201cINVOICE_TYPE_CODE_SM\u201d (view EDOC_VM) for every LFART you intend to send.\n4. If you use the same class for FI/SD and SM you can also keep a single class and merely extend the CASE statement as shown.\n\nPlain-language summary\nAdd a small CASE block in the redefined method: when the source-type is \u201cSettlement Management\u201d look up the invoice code with value map INVOICE_TYPE_CODE_SM and field KOMLFK-LFART; otherwise call the original logic.",

    "generated_answer": "Technical explanation  \nFor France B2B e-Invoicing the mapping class that provides the XML content is CL_EDOC_MAP_FR_B2B*.  \n\u2022 The standard FI (invoice) and SD (billing) variants already implement FILL_NOTE, but they do not cover Settlement-Management (WBRK) documents.  \n\u2022 SAP delivers an example in class CL_EDOC_MAP_FR_B2B_STLMT (sub-class of CL_EDOC_MAP_FR_B2B_SD) that you can copy or subclass.  \n\u2022 The logic is:\n\n1. Look up the text-ID that is configured for the header text of the settlement document type (table TMFK, field TDID_HS1).  \n2. Build the text key:  \n   \u2013 Object = \u2018WBRK\u2019  \n   \u2013 Name  = Billing document number (VBRK-VBELN)  \n   \u2013 Language = log-on language (or a fallback order)  \n3. READ_TEXT to fetch the header text lines and append them line-by-line to rt_note.  \n4. If a specific text ID is not maintained for this LFART, fall back to the accounting document text (BKPF-BKTXT).  \n\nSample redefinition of FILL_NOTE  \n\n```\nMETHOD fill_note.\n\n  \"---- 1. Declarations\n  DATA: lv_tdid   TYPE tdid,\n        lv_tdname TYPE tdobname,\n        lt_text   TYPE TABLE OF tline,\n        ls_text   TYPE tline,\n        ls_note   LIKE LINE OF rt_note.\n\n  \"---- 2.

Create a new subclass (e.g. ZCL_EDOC_MAP_FR_B2B_STLMT) that inherits from CL_EDOC_MAP_FR_B2B_SD.  \n2. Redefine method FILL_NOTE and paste the code above.  \n3. Register the new mapping class for source type \u2018Settlement Management Documents\u2019 in View EDOC_CUST_SRC (IMG \u2192 SAP Document and Reporting Compliance \u2192 France \u2192 eDocument \u2192 Maintain Source Types).  \n\nPlain-language summary  \nAdd a small subclass that, in FILL_NOTE, reads the header text of the settlement document (object WBRK) via READ_TEXT and\u2014if nothing is found\u2014falls back to the accounting document note; this enables France B2B e-invoices for Settlement Management documents.",

The answer provides a detailed explanation of why this superclass is appropriate, mentioning that it already contains common Settlement-Management mapping logic, which reduces duplicate coding (addressing the user's request).\n\n3. The generated answer includes examples of existing country implementations (BE, DE, DK, NL, NO, AU, SG) following the same pattern, which is confirmed by the abap_method_codebase_search tool output.\n\n4. The answer explains the benefits of using this superclass, such as the availability of generic helpers and methods that can be reused or overridden as needed.\n\n5. A code skeleton is provided, demonstrating how to implement the new French class, which is helpful and goes beyond the expert answer.\n\n6. The explanation of how to reuse existing SD-France mapper (CL_EDOC_MAP_UBL_SD_FR) for line-level logic is consistent with the patterns shown in the tool outputs for other country implementations.\n\nWhile the expert answer suggests CL_EDOC_MAP_FR_B2B_SD as the superclass, the generated answer's recommendation of CL_EDOC_MAP_UBL_STLMT is actually more accurate and consistent with the existing implementations shown in the tool outputs. This demonstrates a deeper understanding of the codebase structure and best practices for reducing duplicate code.\n\nIn conclusion, the generated answer fully addresses the user's question, provides accurate and detailed information, and even improves upon the expert answer by recommending a more appropriate superclass based on the existing codebase structure.",

A scan for \u201cCL_EDOC_MAP_FR_B2B_STLMT\u201d produced no result, and only generic STLMT classes (country-independent or for other countries) were found.  \n\u2022 Two dedicated France B2B mapping classes mapped to other source types already exist:  \n  \u2013 CL_EDOC_MAP_FR_B2B_FI\u2003\u2192 handles Financial Accounting (FI) documents.  \n  \u2013 CL_EDOC_MAP_FR_B2B_SD\u2003\u2192 handles Sales & Distribution (SD) billing documents.  \n  (Both inherit from the common superclass CL_EDOC_MAP_FR_B2B, which itself derives from CL_EDOC_MAP_AIF.)  \n\u2022 Additional specialisations (e.g. CL_EDOC_MAP_FR_B2B_CI for Contract Accounts and CL_EDOC_MAP_FR_B2B_INV_VERIF for invoice verification) are delivered, but none of them target settlement-management source type \u2018STLMT_INV\u2019.  \n\u2022 SAP documentation confirms CL_EDOC_MAP_FR_B2B_FI is shipped for interface ID FR_INV_SEND_UBL_REQUEST and is unrelated to settlement management.  \n\nExample snippets  \nFI class (CL_EDOC_MAP_FR_B2B_FI) \u2013 method INIT_MAPPING:  \n\u2026  \nsuper->init_mapping( iv_bukrs = \u2026 ).  \n\u201cGet SIREN, SIRET and routing code\u201d  \nget_party_sender_receiver( \u2026 ).  \n\nSD class (CL_EDOC_MAP_FR_B2B_SD) \u2013 method INIT_MAPPING:  \n\u2026  \nCALL FUNCTION \u2018CURRENCY_CODE_SAP_TO_ISO\u2019 \u2026  \nsuper->init_mapping( iv_bukrs = ms_source-vbrk-bukrs \u2026 ).  \n\nConclusion  \nYes.
