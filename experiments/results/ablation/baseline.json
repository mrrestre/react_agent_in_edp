    "answer": "To attach additional files to the standard XML in Public Cloud, you can use the Business Add-In (BAdI) EDOC_ADAPTOR_CLOUD and enhance the XML file generated for an electronic document.\nBy enhancing the XML file, you can include additional information that may be relevant for your business processes .\nTo implement this enhancement, you can follow these steps in ABAP Development Tools (ADT):\n1. In your ABAP project, go to the enhancement spot ES_EDOCUMENT_CLOUD and select 'New BAdI Enhancement Implementation'.\n2. Enter a package, name, and description for the implementation.\n3. Choose 'Add BAdI Implementation' and select EDOC_ADAPTOR_CLOUD .\n4. (Optional) Create a BAdI filter for Country and/or Generic Filter.\n5. Choose 'Implementing Class' to create a new implementation class.\n6. Activate your BAdI implementation .\nOnce you have implemented the BAdI, you can fill the XML tag <BuyersItemIdentification> with the desired additional information.\nThis can be done by reading the relevant data from the source documents and filling the appropriate XML tags.\nPlease note that the specific implementation details may vary depending on your system setup and requirements.\nIt is recommended to refer to the provided sources for more detailed instructions and examples.",

    "generated_answer": "Technical explanation  \n\u2022 In SAP S/4HANA Cloud, public edition, the cockpit apps \u201cManage Electronic Documents\u201d (F2673) and \u201ceDocument Cockpit\u201d (F4306) are SAP-delivered UI5 applications.  \n\u2022 All toolbar buttons (\u201cDisplay\u201d, \u201cSubmit\u201d, \u201cGet Status\u201d, \u201cCustomer\u201d, \u201cSupplier\u201d, \u2026) are hard-coded and registered in SAP-owned tables such as EDOPROCFUNCASGV. These tables are not released for key-user or developer modification in the public-cloud ABAP scope.  \n\u2022 The only extensibility points delivered for the cockpit are Business Add-Ins that let you change INTERNAL behaviour of an existing button, e.g.  \n  \u2013 BAdI EDOC_PART_CONN_CHANGE_EMAIL_V2 \u2192 adjust subject, body, recipients of the standard e-mail triggered by the \u201cCustomer/Supplier\u201d buttons.  \n  \u2013 BAdI EDOC_CUSTOM_FIELDS_CLOUD \u2192 fill additional columns shown in the cockpit list.  \n  They do not let you register a new UI action.  \n\u2022 Public-cloud restrictions forbid classic UI modifications and the addition of SAPUI5 controls to an SAP-delivered app. Therefore a \u201cnew button\u201d (or the replacement of a standard one) cannot be implemented inside the cockpit itself.  \n\u2022 If you must run a custom\u2010developed eDocument process with its own lifecycle steps, the supported pattern is:  \n  1. Build the custom logic in an ABAP Cloud class or on SAP BTP.  \n  2. Expose it via RAP or OData.  \n  3. Build a separate Fiori or CAP application that calls the public eDocument APIs (EDM_* services) or your own API \u2013 this app lives next to, not inside, the standard cockpit.  \n\nAnswer to the question  \nNo \u2013 in the S/4HANA Cloud public edition you cannot extend or add a new \u201cAction\u201d button inside the eDocument Cockpit. You can only influence the behaviour of existing buttons via the released BAdIs; a completely new action requires a side-by-side extension (custom UI) rather than an in-place enhancement.\n\nPlain-language summary  \nThe cockpit\u2019s toolbar is locked in the public cloud: you may tweak what an existing button does, but you cannot add or replace buttons for a custom process\u2014create a separate app instead.",

SAP S/4HANA Public Cloud explicitly supports key-user and developer extensibility for the \u201cManage Electronic Documents\u201d (F1930) and \u201ceDocument Cockpit\u201d (F1619) apps.  \nThe standard way is:\n\n1. Create the field  \n   \u2022 Fiori app \u201cCustom Fields\u201d (F1481)  \n   \u2022 Business Context: \u201cDocument Compliance\u201d  \n   \u2022 Define label / data type \u2192 Publish  \n     \u2192 System appends the field to the CDS view I_EDOCUMENT, the DB include EDOC_CI_*, and the OData service used by both cockpit apps.\n\n2. Fill the field at run-time  \n   \u2022 Fiori app \u201cCustom Logic\u201d \u2192 Create implementation  \n   \u2022 Business Context: \u201cDocument Compliance\u201d  \n   \u2022 BAdI name: EDOC_CUSTOM_FIELDS_CLOUD  \n   \u2022 (Optionally specify process filter e.g. PEPPOL_EINVOICE, EINV_IN, NFE_BR_OUT \u2026)  \n   \u2022 ABAP code sample:  \n     ```\n     ct_custom_fields-my_ext_field = is_source_document-salesorg.\n     ```  \n\n3. Control how the field appears in the UI (optional)  \n   \u2022 BAdI EDOC_CUSTOM_FIELDS_UI_CLOUD lets you change label, visibility, read-only status, etc.\n\n4. Expose it to end users  \n   \u2022 In the grid of either app choose \u201cSettings \u2192 Adapt Columns\u201d, tick the new field.\n\nNo additional transports are needed; the Adaptation Transport Organizer (ATO) moves the objects automatically between SAP S/4HANA Cloud tenants.\n\nQuick example  \n\u2013 Requirement: show the sales region in the cockpit for Italian e-invoices.  \n1. Custom Field Z_SALES_REGION (Business Context \u201cDocument Compliance\u201d, type CHAR 4).  \n2. Custom Logic for BAdI EDOC_CUSTOM_FIELDS_CLOUD, filter = EINV_IT, code copies VKBUR from the billing document.  \n3. (Optional) UI BAdI to make the column visible by default.  \n4. Users add column \u201cSales Region\u201d in the Manage Electronic Documents app and can filter or sort by it.\n\nPlain-language answer  \nYes\u2014you can add your own fields to the eDocument Cockpit / Manage Electronic Documents apps in SAP S/4HANA Public Cloud. Use the \u201cCustom Fields\u201d app to create the field and the provided BAdIs to fill and display it.",

    "generated_answer": "Technical explanation  \nYes. SAP delivers a documented in-app extension scenario called \u201cExtension of eDocument Cockpit with Custom Fields and Enhanced Authorization\u201d that lets you hide or show electronic documents according to a value you store in a custom field (for example, company code, sales organisation, profit centre). The same mechanism works for both Fiori apps \u2013 Manage Electronic Documents and eDocument Cockpit \u2013 because both read the CDS view C_EDOCUMENTHEADER that you extend.\n\nImplementation outline  \n1. Create a custom field  \n   \u2022 App \u201cCustom Fields and Logic\u201d (F1481) \u2013 Business Context = CA-GTF-CSC-EDO (Electronic Document \u2013 Header).  \n   \u2022 Type \u201cCode/Association\u201d to the organisational master data you want (I_CompanyCode, I_SalesOrganization \u2026).  \n   \u2022 Enable usage in UI \u201ceDocument Cockpit\u201d (and \u201cManage Electronic Documents\u201d) and OData service ElectronicDocumentHeader. Publish.\n\n2. Fill the field at runtime  \n   \u2022 Implement BAdI EDOCUMENT_EXT_FLD_MAP (enhancement spot CA-GTF-CSC-EDO-EXT).  \n   \u2022 Map the organisational unit from the source billing or accounting document to the extension field when the eDocument is created.\n\n3. Show the field on the list report / filter bar  \n   \u2022 Use \u201cAdapt UI\u201d in the cockpit or Manage Electronic Documents app; add the new field as a column and as a global filter if desired.\n\n4. Define who may see which organisational units  \n   Option A \u2013 Custom authorisation object (e.g. Z_EDO_ORG with fields ACTVT, Z_ORGUNIT) inserted in the user\u2019s role.  \n   Option B \u2013 Custom Business Object that stores \u201cUser \u2194 OrgUnit\u201d mappings.\n\n5. Enforce the authorisation at runtime  \n   \u2022 Implement BAdI EDOCUMENT_AUTH_CHECK.  \n   \u2022 Method CHECK_AUTH receives CT_EDOC_HDR; delete any rows whose Z_ORGUNIT value is not authorised for the current user. Deleted rows never reach the UI, so the document stays invisible.\n\n6. Transport / publish; no core modification is required. The same enhancements automatically apply to both apps because they share the same CDS and OData service.\n\nShort code example (BAdI EDOCUMENT_AUTH_CHECK)  \n```\nloop at ct_edoc_hdr assigning <ls_hdr>.\n  authority-check object 'Z_EDO_ORG'\n    id 'ACTVT'    field '03'\n    id 'Z_ORGUNIT' field <ls_hdr>-z_orgunit.\n  if sy-subrc <> 0.\n    delete ct_edoc_hdr.\n  endif.\nendloop.\n```\n\nResult  \nAfter these steps each user only sees eDocuments whose custom-field value passes your extra authorisation check, effectively restricting visibility by organisational unit (or any other criterion you store).\n\nPlain-language summary  \nYes\u2014you can hide or show eDocuments per user by adding a custom field to the document header, filling it with an organisational value, and performing an extra BAdI authorisation check so the apps only list the documents the user is allowed to see.",

You can hook into that check and return \u201cfalse\u201d whenever your own business conditions are met. Two points in the framework are released for that purpose:\n\n1. BAdI EDOC_ADAPTOR_CLOUD (Enhancement Spot ES_EDOCUMENT_CLOUD \u2013 developer extensibility)  \n   \u2022 Implement method CHECK_CREATION_ALLOWED (or the release-equivalent name shown in ADT).  \n   \u2022 Inspect the importing structure IS_SOURCE_DATA (billing header, items, customer, etc.).  \n   \u2022 If the document must not be converted into an eDocument, set EV_IS_RELEVANT = abap_false (or raise an exception).  \n   \u2022 Result: The source document is saved in SD/FI, but no entry appears in \u201cManage Electronic Documents\u201d or \u201ceDocument Cockpit\u201d.\n\n   Minimal code sample  \n\n   ```\n   METHOD if_edoc_adaptor_cloud~check_creation_allowed.\n     \"Example: skip zero-value billing documents\n     IF is_billing_header-net_value = 0.\n       ev_is_relevant = abap_false.\n       RETURN.\n     ENDIF.\n\n     \"Example: skip internal customers\n     SELECT SINGLE kna1~ktokd\n       INTO @DATA(lv_acct_grp)\n       FROM kna1\n       WHERE kunnr = @is_billing_header-partner.\n     IF lv_acct_grp = 'ZDUM'.         \"internal account group\n       ev_is_relevant = abap_false.\n     ENDIF.\n   ENDMETHOD.\n   ```\n\n2. Source-extension interface IF_EDOC_SOURCE_EXTENSION \u2192 IS_RELEVANT (key-user or developer)  \n   \u2022 Can be implemented in a Z-class registered through SSCUI \u201cRegister Handling Classes for Source Extension\u201d.  \n   \u2022 Called even earlier than the BAdI; returning abap_false also suppresses creation.\n\nBoth artefacts are already available for country/region DE. No additional license or SAP note is required.\n\nWhat the user experiences  \n\u2022 In the SD/FI transaction the invoice posts normally.  \n\u2022 Because your logic said \u201cnot relevant\u201d, the record never shows up in the Fiori app \u201cManage Electronic Documents\u201d nor in the backend \u201ceDocument Cockpit\u201d.  \n\u2022 All other invoices continue to create eDocuments as before.\n\nPlain-language summary  \nYes\u2014you can stop an eDocument from being created whenever you like (for example, for zero-amount invoices or internal customers) by implementing the released BAdI EDOC_ADAPTOR_CLOUD or the IS_RELEVANT method of the source extension; they let you return \u201cnot relevant\u201d, and then the invoice simply bypasses the Manage Electronic Documents and eDocument Cockpit apps.",

Customising switches in CBC/SSCUI (no code).  \n  2. A relevance BAdI that can programmatically return \u201cnot relevant\u201d.  \n\nSteps to implement the restriction in SAP S/4HANA Cloud, public edition (Spain)\n\n1. Remove the mapping that triggers the document (pure configuration)  \n   a. CBC \u2192 Configure Your Solution \u2192 Finance \u2192 Document and Reporting Compliance \u2192  \n      \u201cAssign eDocument Type to FI/SD/CI Document Type (Spain)\u201d.  \n   b. Delete or change the entry that links your billing / FI posting type to ES_INV (or any other Spanish eDocument type).  \n   Result: when the source document is posted no entry is found \u2013 the factory returns *no eDocument* (see Help extract \u201cAssign eDocument Type \u2026\u201d).  \n\n2. or deactivate the source type itself (affects all doc. types)  \n   CBC \u2192 \u201cActivate Source Type Documents for Company Code\u201d.  \n   Remove the line for Source Type = FI_INVOICE / SD_INVOICE / CI_INVOICE and your ES company code.  \n   Without an active source type the framework never calls the factory class.  \n\n3. Optional: implement a fine-grained filter via BAdI  \n   a. APP \u201cCustom Logic\u201d (or ADT) \u2192 Create enhancement implementation for BAdI EDOC_RO_MODIFY_RELEVANT (Help extract \u201cBAdI \u2026 modify relevance\u201d).  \n   b. Sample code:  \n\n      ```\n      METHOD if_edoc_ro_modify_relevant~change_relevance.\n         \"Reject creation for company codes other than ES01\n         IF is_source_data-bukrs <> 'ES01'.\n            ch_edocument_relevant = abap_false.\n         ENDIF.\n      ENDMETHOD.\n      ```\n\n   c. Activate and transport.  The method is executed before the factory is called; returning ABAP_FALSE stops creation while allowing other company codes to continue.\n\n4. Restrict manual creation in the Fiori apps (authorisations)  \n   a. Maintain Business Roles \u2192 open the role that contains catalog SAP_CA_BC_EDOC_CM (or catalog that exposes app \u201cCreate Electronic Documents Manually \u2013 Special Cases\u201d, app-ID F7437).  \n   b. Delete the catalog or add an \u201cOrganisational Unit\u201d restriction so users cannot start the manual-create action (see Help section \u201cauthorization checks to restrict the visibility of electronic documents\u201d).  \n\n5. Test  \n   \u2013 Post an SD billing document or FI invoice for the Spanish company code.  \n   \u2013 Open \u201cManage Electronic Documents\u201d / \u201ceDocument Cockpit\u201d; the document should no longer appear.  \n   \u2013 If a BAdI is in use, run the same test with a company code that should still allow creation to ensure the logic only blocks the intended cases.\n\nPlain-language summary\nTurn off Spain eInvoice creation by either removing the configuration that links your invoices to the Spain eDocument type, de-activating the source type for the company code, or\u2014if you need a selective block\u2014implementing the delivered BAdI that can return \u201cnot relevant\u201d.

    "agent_judge_reasoning": "The generated answer is fully helpful and accurately addresses the user's question about enhancing the generated XML for a Turkish customer invoice process in Public Cloud using ADT before sending it to the authorities. Here's why:\n\n1. Accuracy: The answer correctly states that it is possible to enhance the XML file before it is sent to the authorities, which aligns with the expert answer.\n\n2. Completeness: The generated answer provides more detailed information than the expert answer, including:\n   - Specific BAdIs available for customization (BADI_EDOC_TR_INVOICE_CHANGE, BADI_EDOC_TR_INV_LINE_CHG, BADI_EDOC_TR_EINV_ID_GEN)\n   - Methods within these BAdIs (CHANGE_HEADER_DATA, CHANGE_ITEM_DATA, CHANGE_EINV_ID)\n   - An explanation of how the process works\n   - Constraints in Public Cloud\n   - An example code snippet\n\n3. Context: The answer mentions that these customizations are part of scope item 5XU (Document & Reporting Compliance \u2013 Turkey) and are implemented in ABAP Development Tools (ADT) via the \"Custom Logic\" Fiori app, which provides valuable context for implementation.\n\n4. Alignment with tool output: The generated answer is consistent with the information provided by the sap_documentation_summary tool, which confirms the integration with SAP Document and Reporting Compliance, Cloud Edition and the ability to map fields to XML.\n\n5. Practical guidance: The answer includes an example code snippet, which is helpful for users who want to implement the enhancement.\n\n6. Clear summary: The answer concludes with a plain-language summary that reinforces the key point in simple terms.\n\nWhile the expert answer mentions the method SET_OUTPUT_DATA of the Business Add-In (BAdI) EDOC_ADAPTOR_CLOUD, the generated answer provides more specific and up-to-date information about the BAdIs available for Turkish customer invoices. This difference does not detract from the helpfulness of the generated answer, as it appears to be more tailored to the specific use case of Turkish customer invoices in Public Cloud.\n\nIn conclusion, the generated answer is fully helpful, providing accurate, detailed, and practical information that directly addresses the user's question and goes beyond the expert answer in terms of specificity and implementation guidance.",

SAP S/4HANA Cloud, public edition for Turkey exposes three dedicated Business Add-Ins (BAdIs) that let you programmatically change the e-Invoice XML just before it is handed over for signature / transfer to the Turkish Revenue Administration (TRA).  \nThe BAdIs are delivered with scope item 5XU (Document & Reporting Compliance \u2013 Turkey) and are implemented in ABAP Development Tools (ADT) via the \u201cCustom Logic\u201d Fiori app:\n\n1. BADI_EDOC_TR_INVOICE_CHANGE  \n   \u201cTurkey: Filling of Invoice Headers in Invoice XML Files\u201d  \n   \u2022 Method CHANGE_HEADER_DATA \u2013 alter, add or overwrite any header-level XML tag.  \n\n2.

By implementing the BAdI you receive the e-mail object just before SAP Business Communication Service sends it, so you can adapt:  \n   \u2022 Sender / To / Cc / Bcc addresses  \n   \u2022 Subject line  \n   \u2022 Plain-text or HTML body  \n   \u2022 Existing PDF/XML attachment (rename, replace)  \n   \u2022 Add additional attachments (XSTRING; MIME type; language; \u2264255 char name)  \n4. The BAdI is cloud-ready: you can create it either  \n   \u2022 In-App (Fiori app \u201cCustom Logic\u201d) \u2013 key-user extensibility, or  \n   \u2022 Developer Extensibility (ADT/Eclipse) \u2013 Steampunk embedded.  \n   The generated class exposes method CHANGE_EMAIL_TO_CUSTOMER (similar name in the editor) with changing parameters for all fields above plus virus-scan profile, etc.  \n5. No further framework coding is required for the standard process. If you build an own process step you simply call CL_EDOCUMENT_EXT_ES\u2192SEND_EMAIL_TO_CUST and the same BAdI will fire.\n\nCode snippet (ADT or Custom Logic editor)\n```\nMETHOD change_email_to_customer.\n* Example: add greeting, attach T&Cs PDF\n  DATA lv_body_html TYPE string.\n\n  \"Add salutation to existing HTML\n  lv_body_html = '<p>Dear Customer,</p>' && is_email_params-body_html.\n  is_email_params-body_html = lv_body_html.\n\n  \"Change subject\n  is_email_params-subject = |Invoice { iv_document_id } from ACME GmbH|.\n\n  \"Add extra attachment\n  DATA ls_attach TYPE edoc_s_email_attachment.\n  ls_attach-file_name = |ACME_TandCs.pdf|.\n  ls_attach-mime_type = 'application/pdf'.\n  ls_attach-content   = get_tandcs_pdf( ).   \"returns XSTRING\n  APPEND ls_attach TO ct_attachments.\nENDMETHOD.\n```\n\nTesting\n1. Create/validate a German eDocument.  \n2. Manage Electronic Documents \u2192 status \u201cValidation Passed\u201d \u2192 press Customer.  \n3. Check recipient mailbox or Output Log; your changes appear.\n\nPlain-language answer\nUse SAP\u2019s BAdI EDOC_PART_CONN_CHANGE_EMAIL_V2 (available in S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition) to rewrite the e-mail before it leaves the system; implement it via the Custom Logic app or ABAP Cloud, change any header/body/attachment you need, activate, and test the result from \u201cManage Electronic Documents\u201d.",

    "generated_answer": "Technical explanation  \n\u2022 SAP S/4HANA Cloud, public edition generates customer e-mails through the Output Management framework (components BC-SRV-FP-OM / BC-SRV-COM-OM).  \n\u2022 The framework already contains an \u201cATTACHMENTS\u201d table that is passed to the e-mail service.  \n  \u2013 Key fields: ATTACHM_TYPE, ATTACHM_SUBJECT, CONTENT_TEXT (text files) or CONTENT_HEX (binary, e.g. PDF/ZIP) \u2013 split into 255-byte chunks.  \n\u2022 Whether anything is put into that table depends on the business object:  \n\n  1. Delivered business-object logic  \n     \u2013 Purchase Order (from CE 2308): any files stored under \u201cAttachments\u201d on the PO are forwarded automatically.  \n     \u2013 Plant-Maintenance Notifications / Orders (from CE 2208): \u201cPrint Multiple Attachments\u201d merges selected PDF attachments into a single PDF that is mailed.  \n  2. Extensibility (BAdIs)  \n     \u2013 eDocument / Document & Reporting Compliance: BAdI EDOCPARTCONNCHANGEEMAILV2 lets you add one or more extra files (e.g. the signed XML) by populating table ATTACHMENTS.  \n     \u2013 Generic Output BAdI APOC_ATTACHMENTS_SELECT (if released for the object) or the object-specific \u201cAdd Email Recipients and Attachments\u201d BAdI can be used in the Custom Fields & Logic app to push additional files.\n\n\u2022 What is NOT available  \n  \u2013 The standard \u201cSend / Resend Output\u201d apps do not show a \u201cBrowse\u2026\u201d dialog; users cannot manually pick an ad-hoc file.  \n  \u2013 For documents whose object template has no released BAdI you cannot attach further files without an SAP delivery.\n\nExample (snippet from BAdI EDOCPARTCONNCHANGEEMAILV2):  \n```\nDATA ls_att TYPE if_apoc_fpm_email=>ty_s_attachment.\nls_att-attachm_type    = 'XML'.\nls_att-attachm_subject = |Invoice_{ iv_edoc-uuid }.xml|.\nls_att-content_hex     = cl_abap_conv_in_ce=>create( )->convert( lv_xml_xstring ).\nAPPEND ls_att TO ct_attachments.\n```\nAfter the BAdI runs, the customer receives the usual PDF plus the extra XML file in the same e-mail.\n\nRestrictions  \n\u2022 Total attachment size \u2264 10 MB (mail service limit).  \n\u2022 Binary files must be BASE64-compatible; recommended file types = PDF, XML, ZIP.  \n\u2022 Feature lifecycle follows the business object\u2019s own release cadence; always check the \u201cWhat\u2019s New\u201d document for your release.\n\nPlain-language answer  \nYes\u2014S/4HANA Cloud (public edition) can send extra files with the customer e-mail, but only when the business object offers it (POs, PM orders) or when you implement the released BAdI to add the attachments programmatically; users cannot attach files manually at send time.",

The answer goes beyond the expert answer by offering a step-by-step guide and an example, enhancing its usefulness.

Open the Fiori app \u201cCustom Business Objects (CBO)\u201d.  \n  2. Define your object (fields, keys, validations).  \n  3. Press Publish.  \n     \u2013 The platform generates an underlying table whose technical name starts with YY1_\u2026, a CDS view and an OData service.  \n  4. In the Fiori app \u201cDefine Compliance Reports \u2192 Queries\u201d create or edit the query for your new-country process and set  \n     \u2022 Data Source Type = \u201cDatabase Tables/Views\u201d  \n     \u2022 Data Source Name = YY1_<your object>  \n     \u2022 Maintain filters/parameters as required.\n\n\u2022 The generated YY1_ table can then be mapped in your document mapping or reporting logic exactly like an SAP-delivered table, but you stay within public-cloud extensibility rules.  \n\u2022 No other way (custom DDIC table, custom CDS view, ABAP table types) is allowed for DRC use cases in Public Cloud.\n\nExample (short)  \n\u2013 Create YY1_ZAR_TAX_CODES with fields Country, TaxCode, LocalMeaning.  \n\u2013 Publish.  \n\u2013 In Query \u201cZAR_EINV_SRC\u201d, choose Data Source YY1_ZAR_TAX_CODES and add filter Country = \u2018ZA\u2019.  \nNow the South Africa e-invoice process can look up the local tax code descriptions during mapping.\n\nOne-sentence summary  \nYes\u2014use the \u201cCustom Business Objects\u201d app, which generates an allowed YY1_ table; direct manual table creation is not permitted in S/4HANA Cloud public edition.",

Use CDS `define table` syntax \u2014 this is mandatory for new custom tables in public cloud.  \n2. UUID (`sysuuid_x16`) is the safest data type to mirror SAP\u2019s DOCID.  \n3. The foreign-key link to SAP\u2019s table is simple:\n\n```\n@AbapCatalog.foreignKey.name : 'FK_EDOC_HDR'\n@AbapCatalog.foreignKey.type : #CHECK\n  client, docid  \u21a6 edoc_header.client, edoc_header.docid\n```\n\n4. All timestamps must be UTC (`timestampl`) in public cloud.  \n5. No buffering or direct maintenance is allowed (hence `#RESTRICTED`).  \n6. If you later expose the table via RAP, add `@BusinessObject` annotations and build an interface view.\n\nPlain-language summary  \n\u201cCopy\u201d the key fields of SAP\u2019s EDOC_HEADER into your own CDS table, add any extra public-cloud or compliance attributes you need, and create it with the `define table` syntax shown above\u2014this gives you a safe place to store additional eDocument instance information while continuing to rely on SAP\u2019s standard persistence.",

    "generated_answer": "Technical explanation  \nTo accept an inbound electronic document from an external system (e.g. SAP Integration Suite or another middleware) in an SAP S/4HANA Private Cloud tenant that runs SAP Document and Reporting Compliance you must prepare the back-end in seven areas:\n\n1. Inbound communication channel  \n   \u2022 Create a Communication System that represents the external middleware.  \n   \u2022 Create a Communication Arrangement for the relevant scope item (for most e-documents this is SAP_COM_0937 or a country-specific scenario).  \n   \u2022 Assign a technical communication user or certificate that the external system will use.\n\n2. HTTP service activation  \n   \u2022 In SICF activate the service path /sap/bc/srt/xip/\u2026 that belongs to the Communication Arrangement (displayed in the arrangement as \u201cService URL\u201d).  \n   \u2022 Expose this node through the SAP Cloud Connector so that the external system can reach it over the internet.\n\n3. Cloud Connector mapping  \n   \u2022 In the Cloud Connector create an HTTPS mapping from the cloud sub-account to the on-premise/Private-Cloud virtual host.  \n   \u2022 Allow only the specific SICF path(s) that you activated above.\n\n4. bgRFC inbound destination (asynchronous document creation)  \n   \u2022 In transaction SBGRFCCONF create a dedicated inbound bgRFC destination (e.g. EDOC_INBOUND) with Type \u201cQ\u201d (queued).  \n   \u2022 Link the destination to a bgRFC Scheduler RFC destination (BGRFC_SCHEDULER_<SID>).  \n   \u2022 In SPRO path Financial Accounting \u2192 SAP Document and Reporting Compliance \u2192 Basic Settings, enter that destination in the field \u201cRFC Destination for bgRFC\u201d.\n\n5. SAP Application Interface Framework (AIF) enablement  \n   \u2022 Activate interface monitoring for namespace /EDOC/* (transaction /AIF/CUST).  \n   \u2022 Give the background user the role SAP_BR_AIF_MONITOR or equivalent so that message errors can be displayed and restarted.\n\n6. Destination mapping for replies  \n   \u2022 Launch app \u201cManage Destination Mappings \u2013 Outgoing\u201d and create a mapping where:  \n     \u2013 Source ID = <Logical System ID of S/4HANA>,  \n     \u2013 Target ID = <Party ID of external system defined in Communication Arrangement>.  \n   \u2022 This tells the cloud service where to send acknowledgements or response messages.\n\n7. SOA-Manager logical ports (only if the scenario still uses classical proxies)  \n   \u2022 In SOAMANAGER generate or adjust the consumer logical port that points back to the cloud service, so that any synchronous callbacks can be executed.\n\nOnce these seven pieces are in place the external system can call the HTTPS URL, the message is accepted, written into a bgRFC unit, processed by the eDocument framework, and becomes visible in the Fiori app \u201cManage Electronic Documents\u201d.\n\nPlain-language summary  \nSet up a communication arrangement, open the matching HTTP service through the Cloud Connector, define a bgRFC destination for the eDocument queues, switch on AIF monitoring, and maintain the destination mapping and (if needed) SOA logical ports\u2014after these settings your Private Cloud system is ready to receive documents from an external platform.",

    "answer": "To enhance the generated XML file for a Greece customer in Private Cloud before sending it to the Tax Authorities using ABAP Development Tools (ADT), you can follow these steps:\n1. In your ABAP project, go to the enhancement spot ES_EDOCUMENT (path: package GLO-EDO > Enhancements > Enhancement Spots).\n2. Right-click ES_EDOCUMENT_CLOUD and select New BAdI Enhancement Implementation .\n3. Enter a package, name, and description for the implementation.\n4. Choose Add BAdI Implementation and select EDOC_ADAPTOR.\n5. (Optional) Create a BAdI filter for Country and/or Generic Filter.\n6. Choose Implementing Class to create a new implementation class. The new implementation class automatically implements the interfaces if_badi_interfaces and if_edoc_adaptor_cloud.\n7. After generating the class, open the interface method and press F3 to view its parameters. To display the documentation, press F2.\n8. Implement the necessary logic in the method to modify the XML tags and fill optional XML tags with values such as customer material number or delivery number.\n9. Activate your BAdI implementation. When you display the XML file of the electronic document in the eDocument Cockpit or Manage Electronic Documents app, you will see that the relevant XML tags are now filled with the desired values.

    "agent_judge_reasoning": "The generated answer is partially helpful in addressing the question about extending an Action in eDocument Cockpit for a custom developed Process in Private Cloud. Here's why:\n\n1. Accuracy: The answer correctly states that it is possible to extend an action in the eDocument Cockpit for a custom-developed process in SAP S/4HANA Cloud, private edition (Private Cloud). This aligns with both the expert answer and the additional context provided by the SAP documentation summary.\n\n2. Completeness: The generated answer provides a detailed, step-by-step explanation of how to extend an action, which goes beyond the expert answer in terms of implementation details. It covers creating the implementation, registering the action in customizing, and linking the action to a custom process.\n\n3. Relevance: The answer is highly relevant to the question, focusing specifically on extending actions in the eDocument Cockpit for custom processes in Private Cloud.\n\n4. Consistency with expert answer: The generated answer is consistent with the expert answer in stating that extension is possible and that it involves configuring a function (in this case, implemented as an ABAP class).\n\n5. Additional context: The answer incorporates some information from the SAP documentation summary, such as the use of table EDOPROCFUNCASG for configuration and the extendability of the Cockpit with custom fields.\n\nHowever, there are some aspects where the answer could be improved:\n\n1. BAdIs: While the generated answer mentions BAdIs briefly, it doesn't fully explain their importance as highlighted in the SAP documentation summary. The summary emphasizes the use of BAdIs for implementing custom logic and enhancing functionality.\n\n2. Email customization: The generated answer doesn't mention the ability to customize email communications, which is noted in the SAP documentation summary.\n\n3. Authorization checks: The answer doesn't cover the possibility of performing additional authorization checks to restrict visibility of electronic documents, which is mentioned in the SAP documentation summary.\n\nWhile the generated answer provides valuable and accurate information, it misses some important aspects covered in the expert answer and the additional context.

Create the implementation that will run when the Action is chosen  \n   \u2022 Copy class CL_EDOC_ACTION_TEMPLATE (or a class used by a similar standard action) and implement interface IF_EDOC_PROCESS~EXECUTE_ACTION for your logic (e.g. call your outbound web-service, write a PDF, etc.).  \n   \u2022 Optional BAdIs: EDOC_ACTION_AUTH (hide/disable button per user) or EDOCUMENT_BADI (fill extra fields before/after your Action).\n\n2.

BADI_EDOC_CUSTOM_FIELDS  \n   \u2013 executed when an eDocument is created or updated.  \n   \u2013 lets you move data from the source object (billing, FI, delivery \u2026) into an append of table EDOC_HEADER / EDOC_ITEM or fill a purely calculated field.\n\n2. BADI_EDOC_CUSTOM_FIELDS_UI  \n   \u2013 controls how the same fields appear in the list and object-page UI of the cockpit/manage app (column label, position, sort/filter, editability).\n\nBoth BAdIs are key-user enabled (\u201cCustom Logic\u201d Fiori app) but can equally be implemented in SE19/ADT because private-cloud = full ABAP stack.\n\nTypical implementation steps  \n1. Create a data element and an append to EDOC_HEADER or EDOC_ITEM if you need persistence.  \n2. Launch app \u201cCustom Logic\u201d \u2192 business context \u201cDocument Compliance\u201d \u2192 add an implementation for each BAdI.  \n3. Inside BADI_EDOC_CUSTOM_FIELDS copy or calculate the value:\n\n```abap\nMETHOD if_edoc_custom_fields~fill_custom_fields.\n  SELECT SINGLE vkorg INTO @es_edoc_custom-zz_salesorg\n         FROM vbrk\n         WHERE vbeln = @is_edoc_source-bill_doc.\nENDMETHOD.\n```\n\n4. Inside BADI_EDOC_CUSTOM_FIELDS_UI expose it on the UI:\n\n```abap\nMETHOD if_edoc_custom_fields_ui~get_ui_definition.\n  APPEND VALUE #( fieldname = 'ZZ_SALESORG'\n                  column_text = 'Sales Org.'\n                  display_type = if_edoc_ui_c=>display_type-column\n                  editable = abap_false ) TO ct_ui_fields.\nENDMETHOD.\n```\n\n5. Activate and transport; the new column appears immediately in the cockpit/manage app.  \n6. (If the field must go to the outbound XML, implement the mapping BAdI \u201cEDOC_ADAPTOR_MODIFY_XML\u201d in the same business context.)\n\nAuthorisation or filtering based on the new field can be added by enhancing the CDS view EDOC_COCKPIT_* or by further logic in BADI_EDOC_CUSTOM_FIELDS_UI.\n\nWhat is not required  \n\u2022 No modification of SAP standard UI code  \n\u2022 No SAP GUI screen exits  \n\u2022 No IMG configuration\u2014the extension is purely BAdI/key-user based.\n\nPlain-language answer  \nYes, in a private-cloud system you can add your own fields to the eDocument Cockpit / Manage Electronic Documents app; SAP ships dedicated BAdIs that let you store the data in the eDocument tables and immediately show it in the Fiori UI.",

Model every action that drives the status flow  \n   \u2022 In SSCUI \u201cDefine eDocument Action\u201d list actions such as CREATE_FROM_HOOK, SUBMIT, SEND_TO_CUSTOMER, CANCEL, RESUBMIT, DELETE.  \n   \u2022 For each action assign a handler class that implements interface IF_EDOCUMENT_ACTION and specify next status for SUCCESS / ERROR and whether it is user-executable from Fiori cockpit apps.  \n\n3. Build the creation hook from the source document  \n   \u2022 Implement BAdI BADI_EDOC_CREATE (method GET_DATA/CHECK_RELEVANCE) to fill structure EDOCUMENT_DATA when an SD billing, FI posting, MM invoice, etc. is posted.  \n   \u2022 Framework stores the result in tables EDOCUMENT (header) / EDOCUMENT_ITEM (lines).  \n\n4. Map internal data to the required XML/UBL/Peppol payload  \n   \u2022 Implement BAdI EDOCUMENT_XML_MAP or interface IF_EDOCUMENT_EXT_ES; write XML to table EDOC_FILE (FILETYPE = \u2018OUT\u2019).  \n\n5.

OBY6 \u2192 Company Code \u2192 Additional Data  \n   \u2013 Create a new line with Parameter Type MY_TTR and enter the real tourism-tax registration number issued by MOTAC.  \n   \u2013 Do NOT use \u201cNA\u201d or leave the field blank.  \n2. Save and re-generate the eDocument (EDOC_COCKPIT \u2192 Recreate XML).  \n3. Open \u201cDisplay XML\u201d \u2013 you should now find the fragment:  \n\n   <cac:PartyTaxScheme>  \n     <cbc:CompanyID schemeID=\"TTR\">TT-123456-78901</cbc:CompanyID>  \n   </cac:PartyTaxScheme>  \n\n4. Submit again; the validation error disappears.  \n5. If your business is not subject to tourism tax, ask IRBM whether the element may be omitted; otherwise register and maintain a valid number.\n\nOne-sentence summary  \nEnter the actual tourism-tax registration number (parameter MY_TTR) instead of \u201cNA\u201d in OBY6 \u2013 once populated, the Tourism-Tax node is automatically generated in the Malaysia eInvoice XML and the validation error is resolved.",

    "generated_answer": "Technical explanation  \n1. How the value is filled  \n   \u2022 For Malaysian import invoices DRC looks for the reference number of the customs form in the PO header text that carries text-type IMPORT_TEXT_TYPE (for cloud) or Header Text (F01) in ECC/S-4.  \n   \u2022 Your own enhancement combines MIGO + PO logic. If IMPORT_TEXT_TYPE is empty the routine still returns the PO-header string that happened to contain control characters (line-feeds, \u201c/\u201d, \u201c\u2013\u201d, etc.).  \n   \u2022 During XML creation the framework validates field ReferenceNumberCustomsForm against the Malaysia e-invoice XSD. Only the characters [A-Z a-z 0-9] are allowed. A single disallowed character triggers error EDOCUMENT_MY 079 \u201cspecial characters are not allowed \u2026\u201d, which prevents PDF/XML rendering.\n\n2. Why you see the error although \u201cwe did not maintain the text\u201d  \n   \u2022 The text element itself is empty, but SAPscript stores an invisible carriage-return (hex 0D) when a header-text line was once created and later deleted.  \n   \u2022 Your BAdI\u2010implementation copies that control character to the eDocument; the validator then rejects it as \u201cspecial character\u201d.\n\n3. Fix / mitigation  \n   A. Master-data / process  \n      \u2013 Maintain the correct 18-digit customs form number (digits only) in PO-header, text type IMPORT_TEXT_TYPE, before running MIRO.  \n      \u2013 Or leave the field completely blank; delete the header text line so no control character is saved (Menu: Header \u2192 Texts \u2192 Delete line, then save).  \n   B. Code adjustment (recommended so the interface is robust)  \n      Implement a short clean-up in your BAdI class (e.g. EDOC_ADAPTOR\u2192SET_OUTPUT_DATA):  \n      ```abap\n      DATA(lv_ref) = condense( cl_abap_char_utilities=>remove_non_printable( iv_ref_no ) ).\n      REPLACE ALL OCCURRENCES OF REGEX '[^A-Za-z0-9]' IN lv_ref WITH ''.   \"strip specials\n      ev_ref_no = lv_ref.\n      ```  \n      This removes both control characters and visible punctuation before the value is passed to DRC.  \n   C. Validation exit (if you prefer to block instead of auto-clean)  \n      \u2013 Activate BAdI DRC_GOV_FORMS_VALIDATE and raise an error when `iv_ref_no CP '*[^A-Za-z0-9]*'`. The user then gets an on-screen message at MIRO.\n\n4. Where to check in the log  \n   \u2022 Transaction SLG1, Object = EDOCUMENT_MYS, Subobject = EDOC_PROC \u2192 double-click the entry to see the exact offending character position.\n\nPlain-language summary  \nThe customs-form number that DRC picks up from the PO header secretly contains a control or punctuation character; the Malaysia e-invoice schema accepts only letters and digits, so the PDF/XML is rejected. Either store a clean 18-digit number in the PO text or add a small ABAP cleanup that strips non-alphanumerics before DRC is called.",

Keep only ONE VAT participant record per company code.  \n   \u2013 Maintain the VAT once in OBY6.  \n   \u2013 Keep a single line in EDOC_C_CO_PRTY with Party-ID Type = \u201cVAT\u201d.  \n2. Route the document to the correct backend by communication settings, not by creating a second VAT entry.  \n   \u2013 Define separate \u201cCommunication Destinations\u201d in the DRC customizing (views EDOC_C_COMSYS / EDOC_C_DEST) for S/4 HANA and for IS-U.  \n   \u2013 Link the appropriate destination to each client/system.  \n   \u2013 The cloud service will look up the company code by VAT, then forward the XML to the destination that matches the sending system.  \n3. If you really must transmit with two different identifiers, choose a different Party-ID type for the second system (e.g. GLN, Leitweg-ID) or implement BAdI EDOC_PARTY_ID to switch the identifier at runtime.

Checklist to resolve (taken directly from sap_help_lookup section 9 and documentation summary)  \n   Cloud (DRC CE)  \n   \u2610 App \u201cMaintain Communication Users\u201d: upload the same client certificate that lives in the backend SSL Client PSE.  \n   \u2610 App \u201cCommunication Arrangements\u201d: set Authentication = \u201cClient Certificate\u201d and reference the user above.  \n\n   Backend (on-prem)  \n   \u2610 STRUST: make sure the SSL Client PSE that contains the private key of the certificate is valid (not expired).  \n   \u2610 SOAMANAGER \u2192 Logical Port \u2192 Consumer Security:  \n        \u2013 Authentication = \u201cX.509 SSL Client Certificate\u201d  \n        \u2013 SSL Client PSE = the PSE that contains the certificate (not \u201cAnonymous SSL\u201d).  \n   \u2610 STRUST: root / intermediate CAs of the cloud endpoint are present (see SAP Note 2801396).  \n   \u2610 If you use a dedicated PSE, set profile parameter icm/HTTPS/client_pse accordingly.  \n\n4. How to verify  \n   \u2022 SMICM trace level 3: after Ping, confirm line \u201cClient certificate sent (serial= \u2026)\u201d\u2014if missing, the logical port points to the wrong PSE.  \n   \u2022 Cloud \u2013 Communication User: column \u201cLast Logon\u201d should update after a successful ping.  \n\n5. Result  \n   After the correct certificate is mapped on both sides and the logical port uses the matching PSE, SOAMANAGER Ping returns HTTP 200 and EDOC_COCKPIT sends invoices without any login prompt.\n\nPlain-language takeaway  \n\u201cBackend cannot log on because it is either not sending a client certificate at all or it sends one the cloud system does not recognise. Upload the same certificate to the cloud Communication User and make sure the logical port in SOAMANAGER uses that certificate\u2019s PSE; the 401 error disappears.\u201d",

For B2B e-invoice the French specification only wants the condition-contract (code \u20181\u2019).  \n\u2022 The contract reference element in the SAP UBL proxy is rs_contract_reference-id-base-base-content; populating that field is enough\u2014no further attributes are required.\n\nSample redefinition (ABAP)  \n\n```abap\n\"Class  ZCL_EDOC_MAP_FR_B2B_STLMT  (sub-class of CL_EDOC_MAP_FR_B2B_SD)\n\"Method FILL_CONTRACT_REFERENCE\n\nMETHOD fill_contract_reference.\n\n  \"Pass contract number from Settlement Management (KOMLFK)\n  \"Only take true condition contracts (CONTRACT_TYPE = '1')\n  IF ms_source-komlfk-contract_type = '1'\n     AND ms_source-komlfk-contract      IS NOT INITIAL.\n\n    rs_contract_reference-id-base-base-content =\n        ms_source-komlfk-contract.           \"e.g. 0004711\n\n  ENDIF.\n\nENDMETHOD.\n```\n\nWhat the code does  \n1. Checks the contract category so that only a condition contract (required by French rules) is forwarded.  \n2. Moves the settlement contract number to the UBL node ContractDocumentReference/ID.  \n3. Leaves the structure empty if no relevant contract exists; the framework will skip the tag.\n\nAfter the redefinition  \n\u2022 Activate the source type \u201cSettlement Management Documents\u201d (STLMT_INV) for your company code in IMG activity \u201cActivate Source Type Documents for CoCd\u201d.  \n\u2022 Map every relevant Settlement Document Type (e.g. 0S12, ZS33) to eDocument type FRB2BINV in IMG activity \u201cAssign eDocument Type to Settlement Document Type\u201d.  \n\u2022 No further BAdI or enhancement is needed; the framework will now build a France-compliant B2B XML that contains the required <ContractDocumentReference><ID> element.\n\nPlain-language summary  \nCreate (or use) a settlement-specific mapping class, override method FILL_CONTRACT_REFERENCE, and copy KOMLFK-CONTRACT into the XML when the contract type is \u20181\u2019; then activate the STLMT source type in customizing and your French B2B settlement invoices will include the legally required contract reference.",

When the eDocument framework reads a Settlement-Management document (`source_type = 'STLMT_INV'`) it already simulates an SD billing header/item (VBRK/VBRP). Hence `is_vbrp-netwr` and `is_vbrp-fkimg` can be re-used.  \n2. For UBL/France B2B the unit-price may require shifting the decimal point if the number of decimals exceeds two. The logic therefore:  \n   \u2022 Extracts the fractional length  \n   \u2022 If more than two, multiplies by 10 / 100 / 1000 \u2026 and sets `ev_unit_quan` accordingly (100, 1 000 etc.).  \n3. `format_negative_amount` is a framework helper that re-applies the minus sign in compliance-friendly format.  \n4. Finally the document currency is copied from the simulated billing header.\n\nPlain-language summary:  \nCreate class CL_EDOC_MAP_FR_B2B_STLMT inheriting from the SD class, overwrite FILL_PRICE_AMOUNT as above, and the France B2B mapping will now correctly derive price and amount when the source document is a Settlement-Management invoice.",

Correct Identification: The answer correctly identifies CL_EDOC_MAP_FR_B2B_SD as the class that is already doing mapping for another source type (SD invoices) but not for settlement management documents.\n\n2. Class Hierarchy: It accurately describes the class hierarchy, starting with CL_EDOC_MAP_FR_B2B as the generic France B2B mapper and CL_EDOC_MAP_FR_B2B_SD as the concrete subclass for Sales-and-Distribution.\n\n3. Method Details: The answer provides details about the FILL_INVOICE method in CL_EDOC_MAP_FR_B2B_SD, which populates the UBL request from SD billing data.\n\n4. Source Type Coverage: It correctly states that Settlement-Management (source type based on MM/SD rebate or MM settlement) is not covered by the existing subclass.\n\n5. Reusability: The answer suggests that the existing SD-specific class can be reused or extended as a template for the new settlement management source type.\n\n6.

Here's why:\n\n1. Accuracy: The answer correctly states that it is possible to create an ABAP class for DRC process mapping in SAP S/4HANA Cloud, public edition. This aligns with the information provided in the SAP documentation summary about the availability of extensibility features for custom ABAP development in the public cloud.\n\n2. Completeness: The answer provides a comprehensive step-by-step guide on how to implement the DRC process mapping:\n   - It mentions using Developer Extensibility (ADT) in a 3-system landscape, which is consistent with the documentation's reference to ABAP Development Tools (ADT).\n   - It describes implementing a released DRC enhancement BAdI, which aligns with the documentation's mention of using BAdIs for extending incoming format mappings.\n   - The answer includes a code example, demonstrating how to create and structure the ABAP class, which goes beyond the expert answer in terms of detail.\n   - It explains how to transport and activate the class, and how to register it in the \"Manage Electronic Documents\" Fiori app, providing practical implementation steps.\n\n3. Context: The answer addresses the specific context of DRC (Document and Reporting Compliance) and its integration with SAP S/4HANA Cloud, which is consistent with the documentation summary's description of DRC Cloud Edition and its integration capabilities.\n\n4. Prerequisites and Limitations: The answer provides additional valuable information about prerequisites (DRC license, SAP Integration Suite subscription) and limitations (use of released objects only, no classic modification techniques), which helps set realistic expectations for the development process.\n\n5. Alignment with Expert Answer: The generated answer expands upon and provides more detail than the expert answer, while remaining consistent with its core message that creating a process-level mapping ABAP class is possible.\n\nIn conclusion, the generated answer not only fully addresses the question but also provides a detailed, accurate, and practical guide for implementing the requested functionality, making it exceptionally helpful for a developer looking to create an ABAP class for DRC Process mapping in the Public cloud environment.",

    "generated_answer": "Technical answer  \nYes. In SAP S/4HANA Cloud, public edition you can build your own ABAP class to perform process-mapping logic for SAP Document and Reporting Compliance (DRC). The supported way is:\n\n1. Use Developer Extensibility (ADT in a 3-system DEV/Q/P landscape).  \n2. Implement the released DRC enhancement BAdI that the framework exposes for \u201cElectronic-Document Processing\u201d.  \n   \u2022 In ADT: New \u2192 ABAP Cloud Project \u2192 BAdI Implementation \u2192 choose released enhancement (for example, BAdI EDO_PROCESSING_EXT).  \n   \u2022 Create your implementation class in customer namespace /Z* or /YY*.  \n3.

EDOCUMENT_BASE_EXT \u2192 decides process & returns handler class  \n2. EDOC_ADAPTOR_CLOUD \u2192 adapts mapping / can cancel processing  \n3. EDOCUMENT_INT_CONN_EXT \u2192 sends data out & handles reply\n\nOnce all three are active (with proper filters) the new process appears in Process Manager, can be selected in the cockpit, and full end-to-end submission works.\n\nCode snippet outline (abbreviated):\n\n```\nCLASS zcl_my_country_base DEFINITION\n  PUBLIC FINAL CREATE PUBLIC.\n  PUBLIC SECTION.\n    INTERFACES if_edocument_base_ext.\nENDCLASS.\n\nMETHOD if_edocument_base_ext~determine_process.\n  rv_edoc_class   = 'ZCL_MY_COUNTRY_DOC'.\n  rv_process_type = 'Z_MYPROC'.\n  rv_version      = '0001'.\nENDMETHOD.\n```\n\nPlain-language takeaway  \nTo add your own DRC process in S/4HANA Cloud, you must implement three BAdIs\u2014one to register the process (EDOCUMENT_BASE_EXT), one to build or tweak the XML (EDOC_ADAPTOR_CLOUD), and one to handle the outbound/inbound communication (EDOCUMENT_INT_CONN_EXT).",

It directly addresses the question by explaining the importance of eDocument types in the DRC framework.\n\n2. It provides a detailed technical explanation of why eDocument types are crucial, covering six key points: database anchoring, trigger linking, cloud service routing, lifecycle control, status/analytics management, and protection against SAP content updates and license metering.\n\n3. The answer includes a mini-checklist for creating a new process in the public cloud, which is valuable practical information for the user.\n\n4. It offers a plain-language summary that concisely captures the essence of why a new eDocument type is needed.\n\n5. The information provided is consistent with and expands upon the expert answer. For example, it explains how different eDocument types can be used for documents that share the same process but have different logic or mapping (as mentioned in the expert answer about regular invoices and credit/debit memos).\n\n6. The generated answer aligns with the additional context provided by the sap_documentation_summary tool, which confirms the extensibility capabilities for eDocument type creation in the Public Cloud and the ability to create new end-to-end business processes.\n\nOverall, the generated answer not only fully addresses the user's question but also provides a comprehensive understanding of the role and importance of eDocument types in the DRC extensibility process for Public Cloud customers.",

    "generated_answer": "Technical explanation  \nIn SAP S/4HANA Cloud, public edition, the Document & Reporting Compliance (DRC) framework drives everything around a single technical key called the eDocument type.  \nWhen you build a \u201cNew Process\u201d with DRC extensibility you must create your own eDocument type because it is:\n\n1. The database anchor  \n   \u2022 Stored in core tables EDOC_HEADER / EDOC_STATUS and in the custom-type table EDOC_TYPEC.  \n   \u2022 Referenced by every follow-on customizing activity and BAdI implementation.\n\n2. The trigger link from source documents  \n   \u2022 Nodes such as \u201cAssign eDocument Type to Billing/Accounting/PO Document Type\u201d require you to choose an eDocument type.  \n   \u2022 When a source document that carries this assignment is posted, the factory class for your new process is called and the correct eDocument instance is created.\n\n3. The routing switch to the cloud service  \n   \u2022 Activity \u201cDefine Process Communication Through Cloud Services\u201d is (Company Code + eDocument Process + eDocument Type).  \n   \u2022 Without your own type you cannot flag the documents for Cloud Edition routing and metering.\n\n4. The lifecycle controller  \n   \u2022 Cancellation rules, deletion logic and XML-display BAdIs (IF_EDOCUMENT_EXT_ES, EDOCUMENT_INT_CONN_EXT) are activated per eDocument type.\n\n5. The status/analytics key in Fiori \u201cManage Electronic Documents\u201d (App ID F4306)  \n   \u2022 Custom status mapping, colour coding, filters and mass actions are stored per eDocument type.\n\n6. A protection layer against SAP content updates and licence metering  \n   \u2022 SAP delivers new content only for SAP-delivered types; custom types prevent overwrites.  \n   \u2022 Metering for on-premise runtime engines counts by eDocument type, so custom cloud-routed types avoid wrong licence consumption.\n\nMini checklist to create a New Process in public cloud  \n1. Fiori app \u201cManage eDocument Process\u201d \u2192 Create Process with new eDocument Type (Zxx) and assign data-provider/factory classes.  \n2. SSC-UI configuration:  \n   \u2022 Activate source document types for CoCd.  \n   \u2022 Assign eDocument Type to source documents.  \n   \u2022 Define Process Communication Through Cloud Services.  \n   \u2022 Optional PO-state relevance, error categories, XML field mapping.  \n3. Implement required BAdIs (IF_EDOCUMENT_EXT_ES, EDOCUMENT_INT_CONN_EXT).  \n4. Test and monitor in \u201cManage Electronic Documents\u201d.\n\nPlain-language summary  \nYou need a new eDocument type because it is the unique ID that ties your custom process to every part of DRC\u2014triggering, sending, status tracking, and lifecycle handling; without it, the system cannot recognise or manage your custom electronic documents.",

However, it has some limitations when compared to the expert answer and the additional context provided by the tool:\n\n1. Accuracy: The generated answer correctly explains the mechanism by which the cockpit determines which \"display\" buttons to show, including the role of the CL_EDOC_XML_PARSER class and the EDOC_ADOC_REF table. This aligns with the expert's suggestion to extend EDOPROCFUNCASGV and EDOPROCFUNCARCV.\n\n2. Completeness: The answer provides a solution by suggesting to embed the original PDF in the AdditionalDocumentReference block of the XML, which is not mentioned in the expert answer but appears to be a valid approach based on the tool's output regarding ZUGFeRD format support.\n\n3. Practical Implementation: The generated answer gives specific XML examples for embedding the PDF or providing a URL, which is helpful for implementation. This goes beyond the expert answer in terms of actionable advice.\n\n4. Relevance to the Question: The answer directly addresses how to display the PDF that originally represents the ZUGFeRD invoice, which was the main question asked.\n\n5. Limitations: \n   - The generated answer doesn't mention the possibility of overriding the HTML Display Function using custom logic, as suggested in the expert answer.\n   - It doesn't reference the specific SAP Help Portal documentation mentioned in the expert answer.\n   - The answer doesn't acknowledge that the solution hasn't been tested, unlike the expert who explicitly states their suggestions haven't been tried out.\n\n6. Consistency with Tool Output: The generated answer is mostly consistent with the tool's output, particularly regarding the ZUGFeRD format support and the ability to handle PDF files. However, it doesn't mention the mass download functionality for Italy Incoming eInvoices, which could be relevant.\n\nIn conclusion, while the generated answer provides valuable and detailed information that addresses the core of the question, it misses some important points from the expert answer and doesn't fully leverage all the information provided by the tool.

    "generated_answer": "Technical explanation  \n1. How the cockpit decides which \u201cdisplay\u201d buttons to show  \n   \u2022 When an incoming XML is converted into an eDocument, class CL_EDOC_XML_PARSER looks for the segment  \n     `<cac:AdditionalDocumentReference>` (Peppol/UBL) or the equivalent ZUGFeRD element.  \n   \u2022 If it finds a child element that contains either  \n       \u2013 `cbc:EmbeddedDocumentBinaryObject` (base-64 of the file) or  \n       \u2013 `cac:ExternalReference/cbc:URI` (link to the file)  \n     the parser writes a header line to table EDOC_ADOC_REF and the binary (or URL) to table EDOC_ADOC_REF_B.  \n   \u2022 At runtime the cockpit UI (method CL_EDOC_UI_ATTACHMENT\u2192SHOW_ATTACHMENTS) checks EDOC_ADOC_REF.  \n     \u2013 If at least one entry is present, the toolbar icon \u201cDisplay Attachments\u201d becomes active.  \n     \u2013 If only the HTML surrogate (mimeCode text/html) is stored, the \u201cDisplay HTML\u201d button alone is enabled.  \n     \u2013 If a PDF is stored (mimeCode application/pdf) the \u201cDisplay Attachments\u201d icon opens a pop-up that lists the PDF, which the user can click to view in the browser.\n\n2. What to change in your push logic  \n   \u2022 Besides sending the HTML you already create, embed the original PDF in the same AdditionalDocumentReference block, e.g.  \n\n     <cac:AdditionalDocumentReference>  \n        <cbc:ID>ORIGINAL_PDF</cbc:ID>  \n        <cbc:DocumentType>application/pdf</cbc:DocumentType>  \n        <cbc:DocumentTypeCode>916</cbc:DocumentTypeCode>   <!-- optional -->  \n        <cbc:FileName>Invoice 4711.pdf</cbc:FileName>  \n        <cbc:EmbeddedDocumentBinaryObject mimeCode=\"application/pdf\" filename=\"Invoice 4711.pdf\">  \n          (base-64 of the PDF\u2026)  \n        </cbc:EmbeddedDocumentBinaryObject>  \n     </cac:AdditionalDocumentReference>\n\n   \u2022 Or, if the file is big, supply only a URL:\n\n     <cac:ExternalReference><cbc:URI>https://\u2026/Invoice 4711.pdf</cbc:URI></cac:ExternalReference>\n\n3. No extra customizing is required  \n   \u2022 The attachment button is data-driven; as soon as EDOC_ADOC_REF contains a line with MIME = application/pdf the button is shown.  \n   \u2022 Make sure your SAP release is on a recent SP of the eDocument Framework (note 3024383 fixed an issue where the button was not refreshed for incoming documents).\n\n4. Where to verify  \n   \u2022 After the PUSH call succeeds, check table EDOC_ADOC_REF (SE16/SE16N) for the created eDocument number.  \n   \u2022 Field MIME_TYPE should read \u2018APPLICATION/PDF\u2019 and GUID should link to EDOC_ADOC_REF_B.  \n   \u2022 Open the eDocument Cockpit \u2192 select the document \u2192 the toolbar now shows the icon \u201cDisplay Attachments\u201d.  \n     Clicking it opens a list containing \u201cInvoice 4711.pdf\u201d that can be viewed or downloaded.\n\nPlain-language summary  \nPut the original ZUGFeRD PDF into the XML\u2019s AdditionalDocumentReference; the cockpit will recognise it automatically and light up a \u201cDisplay Attachments\u201d icon so users can open the PDF next to the HTML view.",

    "generated_answer": "Technical explanation  \n1. What the certificate is  \n  \u2022 For the \u201cCommunication User\u201d you create in SAP S/4HANA Cloud you must store the PUBLIC key of the system that will call your tenant (inbound mutual-TLS).  \n  \u2022 In the Peppol scenario that is either  \n    \u2013 the certificate issued to your own SAP BTP Peppol Exchange service key, or  \n    \u2013 the certificate provided by the external Peppol Access-Point operator you work with.  \n  \u2022 It is a standard X.509 certificate, public part only, no private key.\n\n2. Where to obtain it  \n  a) If you use SAP Peppol Exchange on SAP BTP  \n    1. In SAP BTP Cockpit create the Connectivity-Service instance (plan = connectivity_proxy).  \n    2. Create a Service Key with credential-type \u201cx509\u201d.  \n    3. The JSON that is returned contains a field  \n      \"certificate\": \"-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE----- \u2026 -----END CERTIFICATE-----\"  \n    4. Copy everything between and including the BEGIN/END lines into a text file (name-suffix .pem, .crt or .cer).  \n  b) If you use another Peppol Access Point  \n    Ask the operator for their client certificate in PEM/Base-64 format; most APs will email the file or provide a download link.\n\n3. File format accepted by S/4HANA Cloud  \n  \u2022 Base-64-encoded X.509, extensions .pem, .crt or .cer.  \n  \u2022 Contents must start with  \n    -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----  \n    \u2026base64\u2026  \n    -----END CERTIFICATE-----  \n  \u2022 Only the public certificate is uploaded; the private key stays with the Access Point / BTP service-key and never enters S/4HANA Cloud.\n\n4. Upload steps in the Fiori apps  \n  1. Open app \u201cMaintain Communication Users\u201d (F2541).  \n  2. Create or edit the user you plan to assign to the Peppol Communication Arrangement.  \n  3. Tab \u201cCertificates\u201d \u2192 Add \u2192 \u201cUpload Certificate\u201d \u2192 browse to the .pem/.crt file \u2192 Save.  \n  4. Later, in \u201cCommunication Systems\u201d choose this user and set Authentication Method = \u201cClient Certificate\u201d.\n\n5. Typical outbound certificate confusion  \n  \u2022 The certificate you download from \u201cMaintain Client Certificates\u201d (Default Client Certificate) is used in the opposite direction (your S/4HANA Cloud \u2192 Peppol).  \n  \u2022 That one must be given to the Access-Point so they trust calls coming from you; it is NOT the file you upload to the Communication User.\n\n6. Renewal / rotation  \n  \u2022 Watch the \u201cValid To\u201d date shown after upload.  \n  \u2022 Replace the file before expiry; simply upload the successor certificate and save.\n\nShort example  \n# File you receive from Peppol AP or BTP service key  \n-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----  \nMIIFdzCCA1+gAwIBAgIQe1\u2026kJZ  \n\u2026  \n-----END CERTIFICATE-----\n\nUpload that file to the Communication User.\n\nPlain-language summary  \nAsk the Peppol service that will call your S/4HANA Cloud (either your own SAP BTP Peppol Exchange service key or an external Access Point) for their X.509 client certificate, save it as a .pem/.crt text file, and upload it to the Communication User; SAP only needs the public certificate, in standard Base-64 format.",
