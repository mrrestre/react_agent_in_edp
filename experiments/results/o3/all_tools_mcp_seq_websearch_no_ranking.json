    "answer": "To attach additional files to the standard XML in Public Cloud, you can use the Business Add-In (BAdI) EDOC_ADAPTOR_CLOUD and enhance the XML file generated for an electronic document.\nBy enhancing the XML file, you can include additional information that may be relevant for your business processes .\nTo implement this enhancement, you can follow these steps in ABAP Development Tools (ADT):\n1. In your ABAP project, go to the enhancement spot ES_EDOCUMENT_CLOUD and select 'New BAdI Enhancement Implementation'.\n2. Enter a package, name, and description for the implementation.\n3. Choose 'Add BAdI Implementation' and select EDOC_ADAPTOR_CLOUD .\n4. (Optional) Create a BAdI filter for Country and/or Generic Filter.\n5. Choose 'Implementing Class' to create a new implementation class.\n6. Activate your BAdI implementation .\nOnce you have implemented the BAdI, you can fill the XML tag <BuyersItemIdentification> with the desired additional information.\nThis can be done by reading the relevant data from the source documents and filling the appropriate XML tags.\nPlease note that the specific implementation details may vary depending on your system setup and requirements.\nIt is recommended to refer to the provided sources for more detailed instructions and examples.",

Alignment with tool-provided context: The generated answer aligns well with the information provided by the sap_documentation_summary tool, covering the key aspects of using the BAdI method SET_OUTPUT_DATA and modifying the XML file.\n\nHowever, there are a few reasons why it's not fully helpful:\n\n1. Complexity: The generated answer provides more technical details than the expert answer, which might be overwhelming for some users, especially those less familiar with ABAP development.\n\n2.

According to the official SAP Help pages:\n\n1. Available enhancement points  \n   \u2022 Four Business Add-Ins (BAdIs) can be implemented in the Custom Logic app (Business context eDocument: Spain):  \n     \u2013 Fill Bank Account Data (IBAN)  \n     \u2013 Fill Delivery-Note Field  \n     \u2013 Fill Discounts and Charges Reason  \n     \u2013 Determine Reason Code for correction invoices  \n   These BAdIs are called during XML generation; you write ABAP code in the generated class stub and transport it via standard Cloud TM.\n\n2. Custom fields / authorisations  \n   \u2022 The Custom Fields & Logic app lets you add fields (e.g. sales org) to the eDocument header/table EDOC_DOCUMENT and expose them in the eDocument Cockpit UI and CDS views.  \n   \u2022 The same fields can be used in catalogue roles to restrict what each user sees.\n\n3. What you cannot do in Public Cloud  \n   \u2022 Change SAP-delivered XML structure, namespace or schema.  \n   \u2022 Modify the core posting logic of billing/FI or the SAP Document Compliance framework.  \n   \u2022 Install classic user-exits or Z-reports in the cloud tenant.\n\n4. Side-by-side options  \n   \u2022 If functional gaps remain, you can build side-by-side services on SAP BTP (e.g. CAP application) and call the public eDocument APIs, but you still leave the standard Spain process intact.\n\nExample snippet (Custom Logic \u2013 Fill Delivery-Note Field)  \n\n```\nMETHOD if_edoc_es_delnote~calculate_delivery_note.\n  DATA lv_delvno TYPE vbuk-vbeln.\n  SELECT SINGLE vbelv INTO lv_delvno\n         FROM vbfa\n         WHERE vbelv = @is_source_document-billingdoc.\n  cs_edoc_invoice-delivery_note = lv_delvno.\nENDMETHOD.\n```\n\nPlain-language summary  \nYes\u2014you can adapt Spain\u2019s customer-invoice eInvoicing flow in S/4HANA Public Cloud, but only through the key-user BAdIs and custom-field framework that SAP explicitly allows; core program changes are not permitted.",

SAP makes the eDocument framework extensible via released Cloud BAdIs (Enhancement Spot ES_EDOCUMENT_CLOUD).  \n   \u2022 In ADT you create an Enhancement Implementation and implement the BAdI that fits your need (for Italy invoices typically EDOC_ADAPTOR_CLOUD or a country-specific one such as EDOC_IT_XML_FILE/ EDOC_IT_XML_CUST).  \n   \u2022 Exit methods let you adjust data BEFORE_MAPPING, AFTER_MAPPING, BEFORE_SUBMIT, AFTER_RECEIVE, etc.  \n2. Prerequisites  \n   \u2022 3-system landscape with Developer Extensibility (ABAP Cloud) enabled.  \n   \u2022 License for SAP Document and Reporting Compliance and a subscription to SAP Integration Suite (runtime to send/receive XML to SdI).  \n3. Steps to extend  \n   a. Identify the BAdI in ADT and create an implementation in your customer namespace.  \n   b. Add filter values (Process Type = \u2018IT_INVOICE\u2019) so the logic runs only for Italian customer invoices.  \n   c. Code your changes (e.g. add CUP/CIG nodes, change routing parameters, enrich header text).  \n   d. Activate, transport to Q-system, test in \u201cManage Electronic Documents\u201d (Fiori F2547) or \u201ceDocument Cockpit\u201d (F2548).  \n   e.

In SAP S/4HANA Cloud, public edition, both Fiori apps\n\n\u2022 Manage Electronic Documents (App ID F4306)  \n\u2022 eDocument Cockpit (App ID F2915)\n\nare built on the Document & Reporting Compliance framework and are \u201ckey-user extensible.\u201d  \nYou can add your own fields and make them available in the list\u2010report, object page, filters, OData APIs, and even in the XML that is sent to tax authorities.\n\nHow to do it (key-user workflow) \u2013 proven by SAP Help outputs above  \n1. Open app \u201cCustom Fields and Logic\u201d (F1481).  \n2. Create \u2192 Custom Field.  \n   \u2022 Business Context: \u201cElectronic Document \u2013 Header\u201d (EDOCUMENT_HEADER) or any other electronic-document context.  \n3. Under \u201cEnable Usage\u201d tick  \n   \u2013 UI: Manage Electronic Documents, eDocument Cockpit, etc.  \n   \u2013 OData: Electronic Documents (API_EDOC_DOCUMENT_SRV) if needed.  \n4. Publish the field (system appends it to table EDOCUMENT and adds UI annotations).  \n5. If the field must be filled automatically, implement BAdI EDOC_CUSTOM_FIELDS_CLOUD (method FILL_EDOC_CUSTOM_FIELDS) or the per-process BAdI exposed in the Custom Logic app.  \n6. Use \u201cAdapt UI\u201d on the Fiori page to place the new field in:  \n   \u2013 the initial document list,  \n   \u2013 the object-page header/sections,  \n   \u2013 the filter bar.  \n7. Transport via \u201cManage Software Changes\u201d to Q/P tenants (no SPRO allowed in public cloud).\n\nOptional developer extensibility  \nFor advanced needs (custom XML mapping, separate process flow) you can create a custom electronic-document process class in ABAP Cloud and reuse the same custom fields.\n\nImportant limitations  \n\u2022 One custom field is shared by all electronic-document processes; process-specific hiding must be done with UI adaptation.  \n\u2022 Classic SPRO enhancements are not available in public-cloud tenants; only key-user or ABAP Cloud is supported.\n\nMini-example  \nCustom field YY1_PROJECTID (10 char) to store project reference.  \n\u2013 Created in business context EDOCUMENT_HEADER.  \n\u2013 In BAdI code:  \n```abap\nIF is_source_billing IS BOUND.\n  cs_edocument-yy1_projectid_edi = is_source_billing-projk.\nENDIF.\n```  \n\u2013 Drag \u201cProject ID\u201d into list and object page via Adapt UI.  \n\u2013 Field appears in API_EDOC_DOCUMENT_SRV, so external monitoring tools can filter on it.\n\nPlain-language takeaway  \nYes\u2014you can safely add and populate your own fields in both electronic-document cockpit apps using the standard \u201cCustom Fields and Logic\u201d and \u201cAdapt UI\u201d tools delivered in SAP S/4HANA Cloud (public edition); no backend modifications are needed.",

EDOC_CUSTOM_FIELDS_CLOUD  \n   \u2022 Called once for every new eDocument.  \n   \u2022 Here you move data from the source object (VBRK, BKPF, etc.) into an auto-generated extension structure that contains all custom fields you have created.\n\n2. EDOC_CUSTOM_FIELDS_UI_CLOUD  \n   \u2022 Called when the eDocument Cockpit UI is rendered.  \n   \u2022 You return the same values so that the field appears in the list/object page.\n\nEnd-to-end steps (taken from SAP Help & official blog \u2013 tool outputs [1]-[2])  \n1. Open the \u201cCustom Fields\u201d Fiori app  \n   \u2022 Business Context = \u201cDocument Compliance\u201d.  \n   \u2022 Define the new field (e.g. ZZ1_TOTAL_WEIGHT, data type \u201cQuantity with Unit\u201d).  \n   \u2022 Publish \u2192 the framework appends the field to CDS view I_EDOC_HDR (and I_EDOC_DOC if detail level needed).\n\n2.

In SAP S/4HANA Cloud, public edition for Germany you can suppress \u2011 or \u201cde-relevate\u201d \u2013 a source document so that no electronic document (eDocument) is generated in either of the two UIs (\u201cManage Electronic Documents\u201d Fiori app and the legacy \u201cEDOCUMENT_COCKPIT\u201d transaction).  \nThe control point is the public-cloud enhancement spot ES_EDOCUMENT_CLOUD, BAdI EDOC_ADAPTOR_CLOUD, method IF_EDOC_ADAPTOR_CLOUD~IS_RELEVANT.\n\n1. Create a new BAdI implementation (In-App Extensibility \u2192 Custom Logic \u2192 Enhancement Implementation).  \n   \u2022 Enhancement spot:  ES_EDOCUMENT_CLOUD  \n   \u2022 BAdI:              EDOC_ADAPTOR_CLOUD  \n   \u2022 Filter (optional): Country = DE or specific company code / source type.  \n\n2. In the generated class implement method IS_RELEVANT.  \n   Example skeleton (released ABAP syntax):  \n\n   ```abap\n   METHOD if_edoc_adaptor_cloud~is_relevant.\n     \"Default is always \u2018true\u2019 \u2013 set to \u2018false\u2019 for the cases you want to skip\n     DATA lv_relevant TYPE abap_bool VALUE abap_true.\n\n     \"Sample rule: suppress zero-value billing documents\n     IF is_source_data-doc_type = 'SD_BILL'\n        AND is_source_data-net_amount = 0.\n       lv_relevant = abap_false.\n     ENDIF.\n\n     \"Return to framework\n     cv_relevant = lv_relevant.\n   ENDMETHOD.\n   ```\n\n3. Activate and transport the implementation.  \n   \u2022 When the condition evaluates to FALSE:  \n     \u2013 Automatic creation at posting time is skipped.  \n     \u2013 In the apps the document appears with status \u201cNot relevant for eDocument\u201d; a manual \u201cCreate\u201d action will trigger message EDOCUMENT 164 and still not create the entry.  \n\nEvidence from tools  \n\u2022 SAP documentation summary (\u201cDetermine Relevance for eDocument in the public cloud\u201d) \u2013 confirms that EDOC_ADAPTOR_CLOUD\u2192IS_RELEVANT is the standard hook and that setting CV_RELEVANT = FALSE prevents creation.  \n\u2022 SAP Community blog \u201cHow to prevent creation of Electronic Documents for zero value invoices\u201d \u2013 shows the identical implementation pattern and resulting cockpit behaviour.  \n\nKey points  \n\u2022 Pure configuration cannot express complex \u201cif \u2026 then not relevant\u201d rules; the BAdI is the supported way in public cloud.  \n\u2022 Works for all source document categories (SD billing, FI, MM, etc.) provided your filter logic identifies them.  \n\u2022 No custom field access needed unless the rule depends on them; those are available in IS_RELEVANT via the structure IS_SOURCE_DATA.  \n\nPlain-language answer  \nYes\u2014you can stop the system from creating an eInvoice or other eDocument when your own business conditions apply by adding a small piece of custom logic (BAdI EDOC_ADAPTOR_CLOUD). When the rule returns \u201cnot relevant,\u201d the Manage Electronic Documents and eDocument Cockpit apps will no longer allow the document to be created.",

    "generated_answer": "Technical explanation  \nIn SAP S/4HANA Public Cloud (Document & Reporting Compliance for Greece) the only released enhancement point for changing the XML that appears in \u201cManage Electronic Documents\u201d or the eDocument Cockpit is the BAdI EDOC_ADAPTOR_CLOUD, delivered in enhancement spot ES_EDOCUMENT_CLOUD.\n\nRequired steps\n\n1. Choose the implementation channel  \n   \u2022 Key user (no ADT): Fiori app \u201cCustom Logic\u201d \u2192 Create \u2192 Business Context \u201ceDocument : Greece\u201d, BAdI \u201cCloud EDOC Adaptor BADI: Modify final invoice XML\u201d.  \n   \u2022 Developer: ABAP Development Tools \u2192 create a class that implements BAdI EDOC_ADAPTOR_CLOUD.\n\n2. Set the BAdI filter so it runs only for Greek documents  \n   COUNTRY = \u2018GR\u2019  \n   PROCESS = \u2018GR_INV_OUT\u2019, \u2018GR_INV_IN\u2019, or \u2018GR_EBOOKS\u2019 (as required).\n\n3. Code your changes in method IF_EDOC_ADAPTOR_CLOUD~MODIFY_XML_DOC  \n   \u2022 Read or create XML nodes via the io_xml helper interface.  \n   \u2022 Fill optional tags (e.g. PaymentMethodDetails, VAT-exemption text) or adjust values.  \n   \u2022 Optional: raise cx_edoc_adaptor to block submission and write an error that will be shown in the cockpit.\n\n   Example (key user syntax):  \n\n   ```\n   \"YY1_EDOC_ADAPTOR_GR\n   DATA lv_fuel TYPE abap_bool.\n   lv_fuel = edocument-get_cust_field( 'FUEL_INVOICE' ).\n\n   IF lv_fuel = abap_true.\n     DATA(lo_elem) = io_xml->create_element( iv_name = 'FuelInfo' ).\n     lo_elem->set_value( 'True' ).\n     io_xml->add_child( lo_elem ).\n   ENDIF.\n   ```\n\n4. Activate and transport (the Custom Logic app publishes automatically; ADT class must be activated in DEV and transported).\n\n5. Test  \n   \u2022 Post an SD/MM invoice, open it in eDocument Cockpit.  \n   \u2022 Use \u201cXML Preview\u201d to verify the enhancement.  \n   \u2022 Submit; the modified XML is forwarded to AIF, CI/IS, and then AADE myDATA.  \n   \u2022 Any error you raised is visible in the cockpit log; user can fix data and press Resubmit.\n\nPrerequisites  \n\u2022 Greece DRC scope items (5XU, BD9) are active.  \n\u2022 eDocument types are assigned to billing, accounting and MM documents.  \n\u2022 Value mappings cover any new codes you insert.\n\nResult  \nAfter these steps the XML produced for Greek e-Invoices, e-Books or consolidated documents is enriched or corrected exactly as defined in your BAdI logic and the change is visible in both the Manage Electronic Documents app and the eDocument Cockpit.\n\nPlain-language takeaway  \nCreate or activate the BAdI EDOC_ADAPTOR_CLOUD (filter GR) in Custom Logic or ADT, add your ABAP code in method MODIFY_XML_DOC, and the system will automatically output the enhanced XML whenever you preview or submit Greek eDocuments.",

    "agent_judge_reasoning": "The generated answer is partially helpful in addressing the question about implementation steps to restrict eDocument creation for Public Cloud customers in Spain. Here's the reasoning:\n\n1. Alignment with expert answer and tool context:\n   - The generated answer doesn't mention the specific steps outlined in the expert answer, such as creating an implementation for enhancement spot ES_DOCUMENT_CLOUD or implementing the BAdI EDOC_ADAPTOR_CLOUD.\n   - It does, however, provide alternative methods to restrict eDocument creation, which could be valid approaches.\n\n2. Completeness:\n   - The generated answer offers multiple approaches to restrict eDocument creation, including configuration changes and BAdI implementation.\n   - It provides more detailed implementation steps and code examples than the expert answer.\n\n3. Accuracy:\n   - The information about using the CBC activity \"Assign E-Document Procedure to Billing Type / Company Code\" seems accurate and relevant.\n   - The BAdI implementation steps are different from those in the expert answer but may still be valid for achieving the desired result.\n\n4. Relevance to Public Cloud and Spain:\n   - The answer specifically mentions \"SAP S/4HANA Cloud, public edition \u2013 Spain\" and provides Spain-specific examples, which aligns with the question's context.\n\n5. Additional valuable information:\n   - The generated answer includes steps for removing manual-creation authorizations and archiving existing eDocuments, which weren't mentioned in the expert answer but could be helpful.\n   - It also provides a minimal end-to-end test scenario, which adds practical value.\n\nWhile the generated answer provides helpful information and approaches to restrict eDocument creation, it doesn't fully align with the specific implementation steps outlined in the expert answer and the tool-provided context. This discrepancy makes it partially helpful rather than fully helpful. The answer offers alternative methods that may be valid but doesn't cover the exact BAdI implementation steps (EDOC_ADAPTOR_CLOUD) mentioned in both the expert answer and the tool context.",

If you need more granular logic, implement the filter BAdI  \n   a. Prerequisites: 3-system landscape, Developer Extensibility, role SAP_BR_ADMINISTRATOR_DEV.  \n   b. In ADT (Eclipse) create an Enhancement Implementation for BAdI \u201cElectronic Document Processing Filter\u201d (technical name varies; in Spain it is delivered with interface IF_EDOC_PROC_FILTER).  \n   c.

Secure trust between S/4HANA Cloud and the DRC cloud service  \n   \u2022 Signed SSL client certificate imported into the S/4HANA Cloud tenant.  \n   \u2022 Service binding in BTP created \u2192 copy the generated OAuth client ID/secret & endpoint URL.  \n   \u2022 Communication System + Communication Arrangement in S/4HANA Cloud that points to that URL.\n\n3. Landscape & extensibility model selected  \n   \u2022 Decide whether the new process will be built with  \n     \u2013 Side-by-Side extensibility (iFlows / Event Mesh on SAP Integration Suite) or  \n     \u2013 Developer extensibility (embedded ABAP; requires a 3-system landscape).  \n   \u2022 Corresponding transport mechanism ready (Cloud TMS or CTS+, and/or Software Collections).\n\n4. Authorizations and business roles  \n   \u2022 S/4HANA Cloud:  \n     \u2013 SAP_BR_CONF_EXPERT_BUS_NET_INT (maintain communication arrangements)  \n     \u2013 SAP_BR_EXTENSIBILITY_SPEC (create custom fields/BAdIs used in the new process)  \n   \u2022 SAP BTP / Integration Suite: AuthGroup.Administrator and IntegrationDeveloper.\n\n5. APIs, exits and data model exposure  \n   \u2022 Released OData service API_EDOCUMENT_SRV activated.  \n   \u2022 Any custom fields added via \u201cCustom Fields & Logic\u201d and whitelisted for eDocument runtime.  \n   \u2022 If Developer extensibility is chosen, the BAdI EDOCUMENT_ENHANCEMENT or relevant CDS views must be enabled in the development tenant.\n\n6. Connectivity from DRC cloud back to S/4HANA Cloud  \n   \u2022 \u201cOutbound\u201d connection in DRC cloud configured with the technical user created above so the cloud service can post status updates or inbound documents.\n\nOnce these six items are satisfied, the \u201cCreate Process\u201d wizard in the DRC cloud edition (or the corresponding configuration in S/4HANA Cloud) becomes active and you can design the new statutory eDocument or report flow.\n\nPlain-language summary  \nBefore you can press \u201cCreate new DRC process\u201d in the public-cloud system, you must (1) finish the one-time BTP setup for DRC, (2) establish a trusted, certificate-based connection between S/4HANA Cloud and the DRC cloud service, (3) pick and prepare your extensibility approach, (4) have the right business roles, (5) activate the released eDocument APIs/BAdIs or iFlow exit points you intend to use, and (6) configure the reverse connection so DRC can talk back to S/4HANA Cloud.\n\nMini-snippet example  \n\u2022 Service binding output in BTP  \n  \"clientid\":\"sb-7ac\u2026\",  \n  \"clientsecret\":\"****\",  \n  \"url\":\"https://drc-srv.cfapps.eu10.hana.ondemand.com\"  \n\n\u2022 Communication Arrangement in S/4HANA Cloud  \n  Scenario: SAP_COM_0599  \n  Service URL: https://drc-srv.cfapps.eu10.hana.ondemand.com  \n  Authentication: OAuth2 Client-Credentials (ID/Secret from binding)\n\nWith these prerequisites in place, you can open SAP Document and Reporting Compliance, choose \u201cManage Processes\u201d \u2192 \u201cCreate\u201d, and define your new compliant eDocument or statutory reporting process.",

Developer Extensibility (ABAP Cloud, 3-system landscape)  \n   \u2022 In ABAP Development Tools you can create a \u201cDatabase Table\u201d object (customer namespace /Z* or /X*).  \n   \u2022 From release 2308 you can also add secondary and extension indexes.  \n   \u2022 The table can be read or updated in any DRC-released BAdI (e.g. EDOC_ADAPTOR_CLOUD) and exposed through CDS/RAP if you want UI or OData access.  \n   \u2022 You must respect the Cloud ABAP subset (no cluster/pool tables, no unreleased APIs) and handle authorisations/ILM yourself.\n\n2. Key-User Extensibility (2- or 3-system landscape)  \n   \u2022 Launchpad \u2192 app \u201cCustom Fields & Logic\u201d \u2192 tab \u201cCustom Database Tables\u201d.  \n   \u2022 Generates a YY1/YYB* table plus a CDS view and OData service.  \n   \u2022 No direct ABAP access; you consume the data via the generated service inside Manage Electronic Documents or a custom UI.\n\nWhat the documentation says (tool evidence)  \n\u2022 SAP Help lookup explicitly lists both options and links them to DRC (\u201cextend the Manage Electronic Documents app with custom electronic-document processes\u201d).  \n\u2022 The DRC extensibility FAQ summarised in the internal docs stresses that BAdI EDOC_ADAPTOR_CLOUD is available only for Developer Extensibility, confirming the technical path to read/write your custom table.  \n\u2022 No SAP note forbids table creation; the only caveat is that you cannot upload data coming from an external ERP and store it in S/4HANA Cloud via DRC\u2014end-to-end processes must start in S/4HANA Cloud.\n\nMini example (Developer Extensibility)  \nADT \u2013 New \u2192 Database Table ZDRC_CN_MAP  \nFields: MANDT, COMPANY_CODE (key), TAX_ID, PEPPOL_ID, \u2026  \nActivate \u2192 create CDS YY1_DRC_CN_MAP and RAP behaviour.  \nBAdI implementation ZCL_BADI_EDOC_CN \u2192 read ZDRC_CN_MAP to enrich the outgoing XML.\n\nPlain-language summary  \nYou can indeed build your own tables in the public cloud and plug them into your DRC localisation\u2014use ADT in a 3-system landscape for full control or the \u201cCustom Database Tables\u201d app for simpler needs, and make sure you call those tables only through the cloud-released DRC BAdIs or generated services.",

SAP S/4HANA Cloud, public edition exposes a released interface (IF_EDOCUMENT_EXT_ES) and several released BAdIs that let you create and register your own ABAP class to extend DRC/ACR \u201cprocess-mapping\u201d logic.

Preparation  \n   \u2022 In configuration app \u201cManage eDocument Process\u201d create (or make sure you already have)  \n      \u2013 Process Name & Version that will be used for Spain (e.g. \u201cES_EINV\u201d version \u201c0001\u201d).  \n   \u2022 If you need a second eDocument per source document, activate factory class CL_EDOC_FACTORY_EXT for the relevant Source Type (e.g. SD_INVOICE) in SSCUI \u201cActivate Additional eDocument Instance Creation\u201d.  \n   \u2022 Create (in ADT) a country handler class that inherits from CL_EDOCUMENT_EXT_ES; this will contain the business logic for Spain (XML creation, mapping, web-service calls etc.).  \n\n2. Create enhancement implementation  \n   \u2022 In ADT choose \u201cNew \u2192 Enhancement Implementation\u201d.  \n   \u2022 Enhancement Spot: ES_EDOCUMENT_EXT.  \n   \u2022 Within the enhancement add a BAdI implementation for BAdI EDOCUMENT_BASE_EXT.  \n\n3. Maintain filter values (mandatory)  \n   \u2022 COUNTRY = \u2018ES\u2019  (Spain ISO code).  \n   \u2022 Optionally also filter on SOURCE_TYPE (e.g. \u2018SD_INVOICE\u2019) to avoid conflicts.  \n   \u2022 Keep only one active implementation per country / source-type because the framework keeps the values coming from the LAST implementation executed.  \n\n4. Implement the ABAP class  \n   The implementing class must expose both interfaces: IF_BADI_INTERFACE and IF_EDOCUMENT_BASE_EXT.  \n   Sample skeleton (replace class names with your own):  \n\n   ```\n   CLASS zcl_edoc_base_ext_es DEFINITION PUBLIC FINAL.\n     PUBLIC SECTION.\n       INTERFACES if_badi_interface.\n       INTERFACES if_edocument_base_ext.\n   ENDCLASS.\n\n   CLASS zcl_edoc_base_ext_es IMPLEMENTATION.\n     \" Return the country handler class\n     METHOD if_edocument_base_ext~determine_edocument_class.\n       cv_edoc_class_name = 'ZCL_EDOC_ES_HANDLER'.   \"\u2190 your subclass of CL_EDOCUMENT_EXT_ES\n     ENDMETHOD.\n\n     \" Return the process/key that cockpit should use\n     METHOD if_edocument_base_ext~determine_process.\n       IF is_edocument-source_type = 'SD_INVOICE'.\n         cv_process_name    = 'ES_EINV'.\n         cv_process_version = '0001'.\n       ENDIF.\n     ENDMETHOD.\n   ENDCLASS.\n   ```\n\n5. Activate  \n   \u2022 Activate the BAdI implementation object and the class in ADT.  \n   \u2022 Add both objects to your Software Collection and transport them with the \u201cExport / Import Collection\u201d Fiori apps.  \n\n6. Runtime check  \n   \u2022 Post or select a billing document.  \n   \u2022 Framework calls CL_EDOC_FACTORY_EXT \u2192 BAdI EDOCUMENT_BASE_EXT.  \n   \u2022 Your BAdI returns ZCL_EDOC_ES_HANDLER + process \u201cES_EINV/0001\u201d.  \n   \u2022 Handler class (sub-class of CL_EDOCUMENT_EXT_ES) performs mapping, signs XML, sends to AEAT (or other Spanish endpoint).  \n\n7. Optional integration BAdIs  \n   \u2022 EDOCUMENT_INT_CONN_EXT \u2013 implement if you need custom HTTP/SOAP logic; typical pattern is to delegate to CL_EDOCUMENT_EXT_ES\u2192process_req_send_global.  \n   \u2022 EDOCUMENT_MESSAGE_EXT \u2013 implement if you want to enrich cockpit messages.  \n\nKey points / tips  \n\u2022 All code must use only \u201cReleased for Cloud\u201d objects (CL_EDOCUMENT_EXT_ES, IF_EDOC_EXT_DATATYPES, \u2026).  \n\u2022 Process name & version returned by the BAdI MUST exactly match what is maintained in \u201cManage eDocument Process\u201d; otherwise creation fails in cockpit.  \n\u2022 Debugging: set an external breakpoint in your BAdI class, choose \u201cExternal Debugging\u201d in ADT, then run the cockpit step again.  \n\nPlain-language summary  \nCreate an enhancement implementation for ES_EDOCUMENT_EXT, filter it to Spain (\u2018ES\u2019), code two short methods that tell the framework which Spanish handler class and which eDocument process/version to use, activate and transport\u2014your Spanish eInvoicing process is now plugged into the S/4HANA Cloud eDocument framework via BAdI EDOCUMENT_BASE_EXT.",

Registers the new process in the EDP (Electronic Document Processing) framework  \n   \u2022 Country/region and business-document category (e.g. SD billing, FI supplier invoice)  \n   \u2022 The ABAP process class that extracts data, calls mappings, sends/receives messages and writes status back (tool output #2 \u00a71)\n\n2. Links all runtime artefacts that make the process work  \n   \u2022 Mapping object (XSLT, CPI iFlow or mapping class) that turns SAP data into the legally-required XML/JSON/UBL/Peppol format  \n   \u2022 Persistence layout in EDOC_* tables so the cockpit apps can store payload and status  \n   \u2022 Number-range object for the internal eDocument ID and, if required, the official document number (tool output #2 \u00a71 & \u00a74)\n\n3. Exposes the process to the Fiori \u201cManage Electronic Documents\u201d cockpit  \n   \u2022 Only eDocument Types entered in configuration activity \u201cDefine Electronic Document Types\u201d (SSCUI 105405) appear in the cockpit where users monitor, resend or download the files (tool output #2 \u00a74)\n\n4. Enables legal compliance controls  \n   \u2022 Validation/enrichment BAdIs, signature logic, sender/receiver IDs and status handling are all triggered by the eDocument Type and its process class (tool output #1 bullets 2\u20133)\n\nWithout an eDocument Type the framework has no anchor-point to:  \n\u2022 know which source documents are relevant,  \n\u2022 run your custom mapping or BAdIs,  \n\u2022 store the generated XML/JSON, or  \n\u2022 show the document in the user cockpit.  \n\nHence SAP requires you to create (or copy) an eDocument Type before any other configuration when you develop a new DRC process in the public cloud.\n\nPlain-language takeaway  \nThink of the eDocument Type as the \u201cfolder\u201d that tells DRC what the new legal document is, how to build it, where to send it and how to display it\u2014so you must create that folder first.",

Implement the methods  \n   \u2022 Within PROCESS_CREATE call helper io_edocument_ext_es\u2192process_create_global( \u2026 ) to build the eDocument shell, write any country-specific data, and return next process step (usually \u2018MAP\u2019).  \n   \u2022 For outbound communication steps reuse framework helpers, e.g.  \n     ```\n     io_edocument_ext_es->process_req_send_global( ).\n     ```  \n   \u2022 Always WRAP logic in TRY\u2026CATCH cx_edocument_ext and delegate to HANDLEEXCEPTION.  \n   \u2022 HANDLEEXCEPTION must write application log, set cockpit status to \u201cError\u201d with io_edocument_ext_es\u2192update_error_flag( ) and RAISE EXCEPTION.\n\n5. (Optional) Map data & call web-service proxies  \n   \u2022 Implement a MAP_* method that transforms SAP source tables to the request proxy structure.  \n   \u2022 Implement CALL_PROXY_* method that builds a HTTP destination via CL_SOAP_DESTINATION_PROVIDER and invokes the proxy class (generated from your Communication Scenario/Arrangement).\n\n6. Activate supporting BAdIs  \n   \u2022 EDOCUMENT_BASE_EXT \u2013 to decide when cockpit should create an eDocument of your new type.  \n   \u2022 EDOCUMENT_INT_CONN_EXT \u2013 if you need to override standard web-service connectivity.\n\n7. Configure the process in the Fiori app \u201cManage eDocument Process\u201d  \n   \u2022 Create Process \u2192 enter description and select the Interface GUID you prepared.  \n   \u2022 Technical Settings \u2192 Country/Region Handler Class = ZCL_EDOC_EXT_<XX>.  \n   \u2022 For every process step (CREATE, MAP, SUBMIT, \u2026) pick the corresponding method name exactly as it appears in your class. Save & activate the process.\n\n8. Test end-to-end  \n   \u2022 Post a business document that triggers the BAdI and creates an eDocument.  \n   \u2022 Monitor lifecycle in app \u201cManage Electronic Documents\u201d (cockpit).  \n   \u2022 If errors occur, consult application log object EDOCUMENT with your interface GUID.\n\nMini-snippet \u2013 PROCESS_CREATE template\n\n```\nMETHOD process_create.\n  TRY.\n      io_edocument_ext_es->process_create_global(\n        EXPORTING iv_interface_guid = iv_interface_guid\n                  iv_variant       = iv_variant ).\n      rv_result = if_edoc_ext_datatypes=>co_step_map.   \"next step\n    CATCH cx_edocument_ext INTO DATA(lx_edoc).\n      handleException( io_edocument_ext_es = io_edocument_ext_es\n                       ix_edocument_ext    = lx_edoc ).\n  ENDTRY.\nENDMETHOD.\n```\n\nPlain-language summary  \nTo make the DRC framework run your own country logic in SAP S/4HANA Cloud you build one ABAP class called ZCL_EDOC_EXT_XX, add a standard set of methods (PROCESS_CREATE, MAP, SUBMIT, \u2026), implement them with the helper class CL_EDOCUMENT_EXT_ES, and then point the \u201cManage eDocument Process\u201d app to that class. From then on every eDocument for that country executes the code in your handler class.",

It covers many important aspects that align with both the expert answer and the tool-provided context. However, there are some discrepancies and missing elements when compared to the expert answer and the tool output.\n\nPositive aspects:\n1. The answer covers the need for proper authorizations and roles, which aligns with the expert answer and tool output.\n2. It mentions the importance of creating a customer development package and using the correct namespace, which is consistent with the expert answer.\n3. The answer includes information about maintaining file types and structures in the IMG, which is relevant to the process.\n4. It provides a detailed checklist and example snippet, which are helpful for implementation.\n\nAreas for improvement:\n1. The generated answer focuses heavily on technical setup and misses some of the high-level considerations mentioned in the expert answer, such as defining new actions, steps, variants, statuses, and flags for the process.\n2. The answer doesn't mention the need to consider message formats and versioning, which is part of the expert answer.\n3. While the generated answer mentions Read Access Logging (RAL), it doesn't emphasize its importance as a mandatory security measure, as stated in the expert answer.\n4.

Scope Confirmation  \n   \u2022 Make sure a new development is really required (verify country/region is not already covered by a standard DRC process).  \n   \u2022 If you intend to use a standard source document (e.g. customer invoice, supplier invoice) you must reuse the existing eDocument type \u2013 do NOT create a parallel type.  (Doc-summary #1 & #2)\n\n2. Framework & Country Readiness  \n   \u2022 Country/Region code must exist in view EDOEXTCOUNTRYV.  \n     \u2013 Missing entry \u2192 open an SAP support ticket in component CA-GTF-CSC-EDO-EXT.

Create the implementation in ADT (ABAP Development Tools/Eclipse)  \n   a. In the ABAP Cloud Project open:  File \u2192 New \u2192 Enhancement Implementation.  \n   b. Choose Business Context \u201ceDocument: Greece\u201d and select the adaptor BAdI above.  \n   c. Accept the proposed implementation class (e.g. ZCL_EDOC_GR_MODIFY_XML).  \n   d. ADT opens method IF_EDOC_CLD_MODIFY_XML~MODIFY_XML for coding.\n\n3.

If your requirement is \u201creuse an existing button but run extra logic\u201d \u2192 implement the relevant BAdI.  \n   Example (ABAP, ADT or Fiori \u201cCustom Logic\u201d):  \n\n   METHOD if_edoc_adaptor_cloud~modify_final_xml.  \n     DATA lr_node TYPE REF TO if_ixml_element.  \n     lr_node = io_xml->get_root_element( )->append_child( ).  \n     lr_node->set_name( 'Z:MyCustomNode' ).  \n     lr_node->set_value( lv_value ).  \n   ENDMETHOD.\n\n   Raising an exception (cx_static_check) stops the action and writes the error to the cockpit log.\n\n3. If you really need a brand-new action (your own button that triggers a \u201ccustom developed process\u201d):  \n   a. Use Key-User UI adaptation or SAP BAS extension project for the Fiori Elements app.  \n      \u2022 \u201cAdd Action\u201d creates an OData function import (e.g. ZEDOC_PROCESS).  \n      \u2022 The button appears next to the standard ones and is only enabled for the rows you mark.  \n   b. Implement the OData service operation in ABAP RAP or SEGW; typical implementation simply calls your own class ZCL_EDOC_CUSTOM_PROC which reads the selected EDOCUMENT keys and performs whatever you need (generate another XML, post to CPI, etc.).  \n   c. Authorisations: check EDOCUMENT key + any custom field you added (SU21 object that reads table EDOCUMENTEXT).  \n   d. Transport like any other UI5 / ABAP artefact; works the same in S/4HANA Private Cloud as on-prem.\n\n   No modification of SAP standard is required\u2014everything sits in your own namespace and survives upgrades.\n\n4. Summary of what is possible without UI extension vs. with UI extension  \n\n   | Requirement | Only BAdI needed? | Needs UI5 extension? | Tooling |\n   |-------------|------------------|----------------------|---------|\n   | Decide whether \u201cCreate\u201d runs | \u2714 | \u2013 | BADI_EDM_CHECK_EDOC_CREATE |\n   | Change payload before \u201cSubmit\u201d | \u2714 | \u2013 | BADI_EDM_MODIFY_FINAL_XML |\n   | Show extra columns / use them in filters | \u2714 | \u2013 | Custom Fields + BADI_EDM_CUSTOM_FIELDS* |\n   | New button \u201cSend to XYZ Network\u201d | \u2013 | \u2714 | UI5 Adaptation + custom OData + ABAP class |\n\nPlain-language answer  \nYes\u2014you can change what the existing cockpit actions do via the delivered BAdIs, and in Private Cloud you can even add your own button by extending the Fiori app and calling a custom ABAP implementation; both approaches are upgrade-safe and fully supported.",

It covers many important aspects and aligns well with both the expert answer and the additional context from the SAP documentation summary. \n\nHowever, it is rated as \"Partially Helpful\" for the following reasons:\n\n1. Completeness: While the answer is very detailed, it doesn't explicitly mention the use of SAP Business Technology Platform and SAP Integration Suite, which are highlighted in the expert answer as key components.\n\n2. Structure: The answer provides more detail than requested, which might be overwhelming for some users. The question asked for steps, and while the answer does provide steps, they are embedded within a lot of additional information.\n\n3. Alignment with expert answer: The generated answer covers most points from the expert answer but in a different order and with different emphasis. It doesn't clearly separate the development in the 3-system landscape from the use of SAP Business Technology Platform.\n\n4. Technical accuracy: The technical information provided is largely accurate and aligns well with the SAP documentation summary. However, it doesn't explicitly mention the Web Services Runtime on backend systems, which is noted in the expert answer.\n\n5. Usability: While the answer provides a code snippet and explains key tables and objects, which is helpful, it might be too technical for some users who are looking for a high-level overview of the steps.\n\nIn summary, while the generated answer is detailed and largely accurate, it could be more concise and better aligned with the structure of the expert answer to fully address the question as asked.",

SAP documentation summary \u2192 customs ODN format allows only alphanumerics and hyphens, 16 chars max.\n\nWhat to do\n\n1. Decide on the data source  \n   \u2013 If the number has to come from MIGO (goods-receipt) rather than the PO header, change your enhancement so it reads the correct MIGO header text (table MKPF, field BKTXT or respective BAPI parameter).  \n   \u2013 Otherwise maintain the PO header text without disallowed characters.\n\n2. Sanitize the value before it reaches the mapping layer  \n   Implement post-processing in BAdI EDOC_ADAPTOR (method SET_OUTPUT_DATA) as suggested in the SAP note extract:  \n\n```abap\nMETHOD if_edoc_adaptor~set_output_data.\n  DATA(lv_ref) = edoc_data-cust_form_ref.\n\n  \"Keep only A\u2013Z, 0\u20139, and hyphen\n  REPLACE ALL OCCURRENCES OF REGEX '[^A-Za-z0-9\\-]' IN lv_ref WITH ''.\n\n  \"Cut to 16 characters (BKPF-XBLNR limit / ODN length)\n  lv_ref = lv_ref(16).\n\n  edoc_data-cust_form_ref = lv_ref.\nENDMETHOD.\n```\n\n   No transport is required for DRC cloud tenant; the change is done in the on-premise or PCE exit.\n\n3. Optional SAP Notes / Support Package check  \n   \u2022 If you are below the support that contains class fixes for method FILL_DCS_REQUEST, apply SAP Note 2932677.  \n   \u2022 Make sure all country-specific prerequisite notes from SAP Note 2783795 (Peppol / eDoc framework) are installed.\n\n4. Retest  \n   \u2013 Create a new MIRO invoice.  \n   \u2013 Submit again in app \u201cMonitor eDocuments\u201d.  \n   \u2013 The status should change to \u201cReady for submission\u201d and both PDF and XML render correctly.\n\nExample before/after  \nHeader text maintained:  \u201c23-IMPF-2024/00015\u201d  \nAfter BAdI sanitation:     \u201c23-IMPF-202400015\u201d (slash removed) \u2192 XML accepted.\n\nPlain-language summary  \nThe DRC XML rejects any character in the customs-form reference that is not a letter, digit or \u201c-\u201d.

What happens when you press \u201cDisplay \u2192 HTML\u201d  \n   \u2022 EDOC_COCKPIT (or Fiori \u201cManage Electronic Documents\u201d) calls consumer proxy CO_DCS_DCP_GENERIC_WEBSERVICE.  \n   \u2022 The proxy must determine the correct AIF interface for process step DISPL_HTML (=\u201cDisplay HTML\u201d) and then send the request to the Peppol Exchange service on BTP.  \n   \u2022 If the logical port or the AIF interface determination is missing/incorrect, the proxy stops and you see the generic web-service error the tester reported.\n\n2. Why the error appeared after you switched the logical port from PROD to PREVIEW  \n   a. Logical-port endpoint was changed, but the corresponding AIF Interface Determination entry was not adapted.  \n   b. In most projects the wrong process-step interface (\u201cUBL_DISPLAY_HTML_RESPONSE\u201d) is still mapped, so the runtime finds \u201cno interface for DISPL_HTML\u201d.  \n   c. In some systems the logical port itself (EDO_EU_GENERIC_WEBSERV or similar) was copied but left inactive or without authentication data (OAuth/SSL certificate), which likewise breaks the call.\n\n3. Required checks & corrections  \n   Step 1 \u2013 Logical port in SOAMANAGER  \n   \u2022 Consumer Proxy: CO_DCS_DCP_GENERIC_WEBSERVICE  \n   \u2022 Logical Port: EDO_EU_GENERIC_WEBSERV (name is free, but must be the one referenced in AIF)  \n   \u2022 Endpoint URL must point to the preview sub-account, e.g.  \n     https://dcseupeppol-preview.cfapps.eu10.hana.ondemand.com/dcseupeppol/dashboard  \n   \u2022 Authentication tab: choose the same method you received from the onboarding (usually SSL client certificate or OAuth 2.0).  \n   \u2022 Activate the port and test the \u201cPing Web Service\u201d.\n\n   Step 2 \u2013 AIF Interface Determination (/N/AIF/CUST)  \n   Path: System Configuration \u2192 Interface Determination \u2192 Define Interface Determination for Proxy Interfaces  \n   Create/adjust line:  \n     Proxy Class      : CO_DCS_DCP_GENERIC_WEBSERVICE  \n     Proxy Method     : SEND_REQUEST  \n     Check FM         : EDOC_AIF_INTERFACE_DETERM  \n     *Process Step    : DISPL_HTML  \n     AIF Interface    : UBL_DISPLAY_HTML_REQUEST            \u2190 IMPORTANT  \n   (If a line already exists with \u2026_RESPONSE, replace it.)\n\n   Step 3 \u2013 Transport / client copy  \n   \u2022 Make sure both objects\u2014the logical port and the AIF entry\u2014are in the same transport or re-created in every target client.  \n   \u2022 Re-test \u201cDisplay \u2013 HTML\u201d.

The answer includes some information that may not be directly relevant to the user's specific problem, such as details about Cloud Connector and Peppol Exchange, which weren't mentioned in the original question or expert answer.\n\n5. The plain-language takeaway is helpful, but it could be more concise and focused on the most likely issues based on the information provided.\n\nIn summary, while the generated answer provides valuable and accurate information, it could be more focused on the specific problem described by the user and the expert. A more targeted approach, addressing the most likely causes first (such as the expired client certification mentioned by the expert), would make the answer more immediately actionable for the user.",

    "generated_answer": "Technical explanation  \nThe connection test in SOAMANAGER (Ping Web Service) and the invoice submission from EDOC_COCKPIT both fail because the backend cannot authenticate itself against the SAP Document & Reporting Compliance tenant (or CPI tenant) in the cloud.  \nThe two knowledge-base extracts show the same root causes:\n\n1. Wrong or expired credentials/security material  \n   \u2022 401 / 403 responses or a credential pop-up indicate that the user/password or the client-certificate stored in CPI \u201cSecurity Material\u201d (or in the BTP Destination) is no longer valid.  \n   \u2022 If a Quality system was recently refreshed with Production data, the old certificate or password might have been transported as well.  \n   \u2022 For S/4HANA systems BasicAuthentication in the BTP destination is not supported; use ClientCertificateAuthentication (private key in PFX) or OAuth 2.0 instead.\n\n2. Logical port in SOAMANAGER uses the wrong authentication method  \n   \u2022 ERP \u2264 6.0: only certificate authentication is supported.  \n   \u2022 S/4HANA: OAuth 2.0 or certificate authentication can be selected; the method chosen in SOAMANAGER must match the material stored in CPI/BTP.\n\n3. Certificate trust not in place  \n   \u2022 STRUST must contain the full CA chain of the CPI/BTP tenant.  \n   \u2022 The logical port must reference the correct SSL Client PSE.\n\n4. Cloud Connector / Peppol Exchange mis-match  \n   \u2022 Host name and Location ID must be identical in the Cloud Connector mapping and in the Peppol \u201cConnection Management\u201d app.  \n   \u2022 Use a technical sub-account user, not the Peppol Exchange UI user.\n\nQuick checklist  \na) In CPI \u2192 Monitor \u2192 Security Material: open the credential/keystore used by your iFlows. Verify expiry date and replace if needed.  \nb) In SOAMANAGER \u2192 Web Service Configuration \u2192 Logical Port:  \n   \u2013 Transport protocol = HTTPS.  \n   \u2013 Authentication = \u201cSSL Client Certificate\u201d (ERP) or same OAuth scope that you created in CPI (S/4HANA).  \n   \u2013 Client certificate = the one uploaded in CPI (same subject/SN).  \nc) STRUST \u2192 SSL Client Anonymous (or Standard): import the full certificate chain of the CPI/BTP endpoint.  \nd) Cloud Connector: check sub-account, Location ID and that the resource path points to /sap/bc/srt/* correctly.  \ne) Re-run EDOC_COCKPIT. If the Interface Log still shows HTTP 401/403, activate HTTP trace (SMICM) and confirm which header is rejected.\n\nExample \u2013 certificate renewal  \n1. Export new PFX from your PKI; upload to CPI \u2192 Security Material \u2192 Create \u2192 Key Pair.  \n2. In BTP Cockpit \u2192 Connectivity \u2192 Destinations: set Authentication = ClientCertificateAuthentication and assign the uploaded key pair alias.  \n3. In SOAMANAGER: choose the same alias in the logical port, save, clear Web Service cache (SRT_UTIL), resend invoice.\n\nPlain-language takeaway  \nThe backend cannot log on because the credential (password or certificate) that your logical port sends no longer matches what the cloud expects; update the certificate or OAuth setup, import the right CAs, and ensure the Cloud Connector settings line up, then the invoices will transmit successfully.",

Treating \u2018WBRK\u2019 as a relevant source type in the subsequent validation block so that the program can retrieve the original SM eDocument and copy its process attributes:  \n```abap\nIF  ls_invoice_header-awtyp = 'BKPF'\n OR ls_invoice_header-awtyp = 'VBRK'\n OR ls_invoice_header-awtyp = 'WBRK'   \" NEW \u2013 SM invoice\n OR ls_invoice_header-awtyp = 'RMRP'.\n  \" update ms_edofrpaymt \u2026 look-up eDocument \u2026\nENDIF.\n```\n\nBecause \u2018WBRK\u2019 is now recognised, the routine can:\n\n\u2022 unpack/pack the correct SM key,  \n\u2022 locate the original SM eDocument,  \n\u2022 read its invoice type (service-based or not), and  \n\u2022 assign the appropriate France payment-process (FRB2CPYMNT / FRB2BICPYM / FRB2BCPYMT).\n\nPlain-language summary  \nThe method was enhanced by adding handling for accounting type \u2018WBRK\u2019; this lets the system identify Settlement Management invoices and pick the right France B2B payment eDocument process for their clearing documents.",

The subclass is only called for the new source type (`STLMT_INV`) that SAP delivers for Settlement Management.  \n2. Field `KOMLFK-LFART` contains the billing-category of the simulated billing document and is the recommended driver for French invoice-type determination.  \n3. Function `GET_VALUE_MAPPING` (provided by the framework) looks up the internal billing category in value map **INVOICE_TYPE_CODE_SM** and returns the corresponding external code required by the French Chorus Pro UBL 2.1 profile (e.g. `380 = Invoice`, `381 = CreditNote`, `383 = DebitNote`).  \n4. For all other source types the logic of the parent class (`CL_EDOC_MAP_FR_B2B_SD`) is kept by calling `SUPER->FILL_INVOICE_TYPE_CODE`.\n\nRequired configuration\n\u2022 Maintain the value map **INVOICE_TYPE_CODE_SM** in transaction `EDOC_CUST_VM` (or the IMG node \u201cDefine Value Mapping\u201d) with keys = LFART and values = Chorus Pro invoice-type codes.  \n\u2022 Ensure the new mapping class is registered in view `EDOC_CUST_MAP` for format FR_B2B and source type STLMT_INV.\n\nPlain-language summary\nAdd a small ABAP override that, when the eDocument is created from a Settlement-Management invoice, reads KOMLFK-LFART, translates it through value map INVOICE_TYPE_CODE_SM, and delivers the proper Chorus Pro invoice-type; otherwise it keeps the existing logic.",

Derive a unit price from the item net value (NETWR) and the settled quantity (FKIMG).  \n2. If the unit price contains more than two decimals, switch to a 1 000 unit-quantity representation (as required by the French B2B XML).  \n3.

In an SAP S/4HANA Private-Cloud system both the \u201cManage Electronic Documents\u201d (Fiori ID EDOC_COCKPIT) and the older \u201ceDocument Cockpit\u201d run on the e-Document Framework, which is fully extensible.  \nKey-user tooling is normally sufficient:\n\n1. Create the field  \n   \u2022 Launch Fiori app \u201cCustom Fields and Logic\u201d (F1481).  \n   \u2022 Press \u201c+\u201d. Pick any Business Context that ultimately feeds the cockpit (most often Business Partner, CustomerCoreView, SupplierCoreView, BillingDocument, AccountingDocument, etc.).  \n   \u2022 Maintain data type/length.  \n   \u2022 In Enable Usage tick  \n     \u2013 UIs & Reports \u2192 Manage Electronic Documents  \n     \u2013 OData/SOAP \u2192 API_ELECTRONIC_DOCUMENT_SRV (so the cockpit\u2019s service can read it).  \n   \u2022 Publish.\n\n2. Show it in the UI  \n   \u2022 Open EDOC_COCKPIT \u2192 Adapt UI (key-user adaptation).  \n   \u2022 Drag the new field to the header or item table, save, publish variant or transport.\n\n3. (Optional) Map it to the outbound XML/JSON sent to tax authorities  \n   \u2022 In the same Custom Fields and Logic app choose \u201cCustom Logic\u201d, enhancement spot EDOC_OUTPUT_MAPPING (or country-specific EDOC_CL_OUTPUT_MAP_*).  \n   \u2022 Sample code (header level):  \n     ```\n     cv_edoc_outgoing-yy1_myfield = is_ext_edoc_head-yy1_myfield.\n     ```\n   \u2022 Activate; every new eDocument generated afterwards will carry the value.\n\n4. Load or update master data  \n   \u2022 Migration Cockpit, Mass Maintenance, or any interface will expose the field automatically once you republish the extension.\n\nWhat happens technically  \n\u2022 A transparent append and two BOBF extension tables (/BOBF/EXT_I_*, /BOBF/EXT_S_*) are generated.  \n\u2022 CDS views I_Customer, I_Supplier, I_ElectronicDocumentH/I are auto-extended, so the cockpit and the API can read the new column without extra coding.  \n\u2022 ABAP fallback (classic append + SEGW extension) is still allowed in Private Cloud if key-user tools do not cover your scenario.\n\nLimitations  \n\u2022 The field is visible only in eDocuments created after the extension is published.  \n\u2022 If you hard-code the field name in a BAdI, re-adjust it whenever you rename/delete the field.\n\nPlain-language summary  \nYes\u2014In SAP S/4HANA Private Cloud you can add your own fields to both the Manage Electronic Documents and eDocument Cockpit apps simply by creating the field with the \u201cCustom Fields and Logic\u201d app, enabling its use in those UIs, and (if required) mapping it in the provided BAdI so it also appears in the XML you send to tax authorities.",

CurrencyCodeID shows the plant instead of the currency\n\u2022 Standard mapping for Malaysia takes CurrencyCodeID straight from the source-document currency (BKPF-WAERS for FI, VBRK-WAERK for SD, etc.).  \n\u2022 Plant (WERKS) is not referenced anywhere in the delivered value-mappings (MY_TAX_MAP, MY_STATE_CODE, \u2026) or in the standard mapping class CL_EDO_MY_*.  \n\u2022 If the XML now contains a plant key, somebody has overridden the standard logic:\n  \u2013 SSCUI \u201cMapping Fields to XML File\u201d (help link e3b18879e3594721a71e35c64c19e907) lets a key user remap any XML element; or  \n  \u2013 BAdI EDOC_MAPPING (Enhancement Spot EDOCUMENT_MAPPING) can change ls_xml-CurrencyCodeID in ABAP.  \nFix:  \na. Open SSCUI \u201cMapping Fields to XML File\u201d \u2192 filter for element CurrencyCodeID.  \nb. If a custom rule exists that points to field WERKS or a Z-table, delete or correct it so that the field \u201cCurrency key\u201d is used.  \nc. If no SSCUI entry exists, look for a customer implementation of BAdI EDOC_MAPPING and remove the custom assignment.\n\nAfter the correction, re-create the eDocument in EDOC_COCKPIT and verify that CurrencyCodeID again shows e.g. \u201cMYR\u201d, \u201cUSD\u201d, etc.\n\n2. Error CF 366 \u2013 \u201cTax exemption reason is required\u201d\nThe mapping routine raises CF366 whenever it finds an item whose tax code is mapped to TaxTypeCode = E (exempt) in value-mapping object MY_TAX_MAP but cannot find a text for <TaxExemptionReason>.  \nMandatory steps:\n\nStep                 | What to check / maintain\n---------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------\nValue mapping        | SSCUI \u201cConfiguring Value Mapping for Tax Types (MY_TAX_MAP)\u201d. Make sure the tax code of the item in eDoc 5100000296 2024 is mapped to the correct TaxTypeCode. If the line really is exempt it must be \u201cE\u201d; if it is zero-rated use \u201cZ\u201d.  \nExemption text source| SD billing: maintain item text type 0001 in the billing doc line.  \n                      MM (supplier invoice): maintain EXEMPT_TEXT_TYPE in CBC and enter that text type in the PO / invoice line.  \n                      CI: maintain external reference type 5040 in the provider contract.  \nLanguage             | Text must exist in the company-code language.  \nRe-processing         | After maintaining the text, choose \u201cReprocess\u201d in EDOC_COCKPIT.\n\nAs soon as every exempt item carries a non-empty exemption text, message CF366 disappears and the eDocument can be submitted.\n\nShort examples\n\n\u2022 SD billing line (exempt milk)  \n  VA02 \u2192 Item \u2192 Texts \u2192 Text type 0001 = \u201cSchedule A \u2013 Milk (exempt)\u201d.\n\n\u2022 MM purchase order line (zero-rated import)  \n  EXEMPT_TEXT_TYPE = \u201cF01\u201d.  \n  ME22N \u2192 Item \u2192 Texts \u2192 F01 = \u201cImport under section 20 \u2013 GST at 0 %\u201d.\n\nPlain-language summary  \nThe XML shows a plant key because a custom mapping was added; remove that mapping so the currency from the invoice is sent.

Where to download it in S/4HANA Cloud  \n   1. Open Fiori app \u201cCommunication Systems\u201d.  \n   2.

Here's why:\n\n1. The answer correctly identifies CL_EDOC_MAP_UBL_STLMT as the appropriate superclass to inherit from. This aligns with the information from the abap_method_codebase_search tool, which shows multiple country-specific classes (e.g., cl_edoc_map_ubl_stlmt_se, cl_edoc_map_ubl_stlmt_nl, cl_edoc_map_ubl_stlmt_be) all inheriting from cl_edoc_map_ubl_stlmt.\n\n2. The explanation provided in the generated answer is accurate and comprehensive. It mentions that existing country-specific Settlement-Management mapping classes inherit from CL_EDOC_MAP_UBL_STLMT, which is confirmed by the tool output.\n\n3. The answer correctly states that the generic superclass (CL_EDOC_MAP_UBL_STLMT) provides the full generic SM framework, allowing the new French class to focus only on country-specific parts. This is evident from the tool output, which shows similar structures for different country-specific classes.\n\n4. The provided code skeleton example is appropriate and follows the pattern observed in other country-specific classes from the tool output.\n\n5. The plain-language summary accurately captures the essence of the solution, emphasizing the reuse of common logic and minimal implementation for the new French class.\n\nWhile the sap_documentation_summary tool provided information about the Italian implementation (CL_EDOC_MAP_STLMT_IT), the generated answer correctly generalizes the approach for France, which is more appropriate given the question.\n\nIn conclusion, the generated answer is fully helpful, providing a correct, well-explained, and implementable solution to the user's question.",

All existing country-specific Settlement-Management (SM) mapping classes (Belgium = CL_EDOC_MAP_UBL_STLMT_BE, Germany = \u2026_DE, Denmark = \u2026_DK, Netherlands = \u2026_NL, Australia = \u2026_AU, Norway = \u2026_NO, Singapore = \u2026_SG, etc.) inherit directly from the generic superclass  \n\n\u2003\u2003CL_EDOC_MAP_UBL_STLMT.  \n\n2. Tool output shows that, inside those subclasses, only the country-specific parts are added; everything generic (simulation of SD billing, SM-specific source data retrieval, generic helpers like INIT_MAPPING, FILL_INVOICE_STLMT, GET_SOURCE_DOCUMENT_DATA_STLMT, error handling, etc.) is already delivered by CL_EDOC_MAP_UBL_STLMT.  \n\n3.

    "generated_answer": "Technical explanation  \n1. What the validator looks for  \n   \u2022 Every Malaysia e-Invoice XML must contain the supplier\u2019s Tourism-Tax Registration Number (TTR) in  \n      /Invoice/AccountingSupplierParty/PartyTaxScheme/CompanyID with schemeID = \u201cTTR\u201d.  \n   \u2022 If the element is absent the validator throws a schema/ Schematron error.\n\n2. Why it is missing in your file  \n   \u2022 The XML is filled only from the \u201cAdditional Parameters\u201d table (EDOPARAMS / SSCUI \u201cMaintain Additional Parameters\u201d).  \n   \u2022 Field OBY6 (T001-STCEG) is **not** evaluated for Tourism-Tax; therefore the value \u201cNA\u201d you entered there is ignored and no node is generated.\n\n3. How to fix it  \n   a. Configuration  \n      Configuration Environment \u2192 Maintain Additional Parameters  \n      \u2013 Select the company code  \n      \u2013 Double-click \u201cAdditional Data\u201d  \n      \u2013 Create or change an entry with  \n        \u2022 Parameter Type \u2026 MY_TTR  \n        \u2022 Parameter Value \u2026 <your 12-digit Tourism-Tax registration number>  \n      \u2013 Save.  \n      (The value is saved in table EDOPARAMS and is picked up automatically by BAdI CL_EDO_MALAYSIA_TAXNUM and XSLT EDOC_MY_* during XML creation.)\n\n   b. Corrections  \n      Implement SAP Note 3497965 (or the latest composite note for MY e-Invoice).  \n      The note updates the validation logic and mapping objects so that MY_TTR is always printed when maintained.\n\n   c. Regenerate / resend  \n      \u2013 Cancel the rejected eDocument in EDOC_COCKPIT,  \n      \u2013 Re-create the source FI/SD document or use \u201cRe-Generate\u201d,  \n      \u2013 Check \u201cDisplay XML\u201d; you should now see  \n\n        <cac:AccountingSupplierParty>  \n           \u2026  \n           <cac:PartyTaxScheme>  \n              <cbc:CompanyID schemeID=\"TTR\">A1234567890</cbc:CompanyID>  \n           </cac:PartyTaxScheme>  \n        </cac:AccountingSupplierParty>\n\n4. If the business is NOT liable to Tourism Tax  \n   The IRBM rules still expect the TTR element; in that case SAP recommends entering the literal \u201cNA\u201d in MY_TTR.  \n   Do **not** rely on OBY6 for this; maintain \u201cNA\u201d in Additional Parameters instead.\n\nPlain-language takeaway  \nPut the Tourism-Tax registration number (or \u201cNA\u201d) in Maintain Additional Parameters (parameter type MY_TTR); after that the XML will automatically include the required node and the validation error disappears.",
