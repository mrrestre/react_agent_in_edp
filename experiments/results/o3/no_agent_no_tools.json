    "answer": "To attach additional files to the standard XML in Public Cloud, you can use the Business Add-In (BAdI) EDOC_ADAPTOR_CLOUD and enhance the XML file generated for an electronic document.\nBy enhancing the XML file, you can include additional information that may be relevant for your business processes .\nTo implement this enhancement, you can follow these steps in ABAP Development Tools (ADT):\n1. In your ABAP project, go to the enhancement spot ES_EDOCUMENT_CLOUD and select 'New BAdI Enhancement Implementation'.\n2. Enter a package, name, and description for the implementation.\n3. Choose 'Add BAdI Implementation' and select EDOC_ADAPTOR_CLOUD .\n4. (Optional) Create a BAdI filter for Country and/or Generic Filter.\n5. Choose 'Implementing Class' to create a new implementation class.\n6. Activate your BAdI implementation .\nOnce you have implemented the BAdI, you can fill the XML tag <BuyersItemIdentification> with the desired additional information.\nThis can be done by reading the relevant data from the source documents and filling the appropriate XML tags.\nPlease note that the specific implementation details may vary depending on your system setup and requirements.\nIt is recommended to refer to the provided sources for more detailed instructions and examples.",

    "generated_answer": "In SAP S/4HANA Public Cloud the XML that SAP delivers for a standard output (invoice, purchase order, e-invoice, etc.) is part of the \u201creleased\u201d scope.  \nBecause of this it cannot be modified or enriched inside the ERP tenant itself \u2013 neither by key-user extensibility nor by a BAdI implementation (the few BAdIs that exist for on-premise are not released in the public-cloud scope).  \nSo there are only two supported ways to add \u201cextra files\u201d to what is sent out:\n\n1. Attach the file to the business document and let Output Management add it as a\n   separate e-mail attachment.  \n   \u2022 Open the document in the Fiori app (e.g. Create Billing Documents, Manage Sales Orders).  \n   \u2022 Go to the \u201cAttachments\u201d facet (paper-clip).  \n   \u2022 Upload the file.  \n   \u2022 Make sure the output type you use is configured with the flag\n     \u201cPrint PDF Attachments / Send Attachments\u201d in Output Parameter\n     Determination (App \u201cOutput Parameter Determination\u201d \u2192 tab \u201cEmail Settings\u201d).  \n   \u2022 Result: the standard XML (or its rendered PDF) is sent exactly as delivered by SAP,\n     and the additional file travels with the e-mail as a separate MIME part.  \n   \u2022 If you need to do this by API instead of the UI, call\n     service API_CV_ATTACHMENT_SRV (or A_ATTACHMENT_API_SRV) to upload the binary\n     to the document; Output Management will pick it up in the same way.\n\n2. Add the file in the middleware, not in the XML.  \n   \u2022 Let the ERP system emit the XML unchanged.  \n   \u2022 In SAP Integration Suite / CPI (or any other middleware) build an iFlow that  \n        \u2013 receives the XML message,  \n        \u2013 queries the S/4HANA \u201cAttachment\u201d service in a secondary call if the file is\n          stored there, **or** reads the file from another source,  \n        \u2013 puts the XML and the extra file together in a multipart/mixed, multipart/related,\n          ZIP or any format your partner requires,  \n        \u2013 forwards the package to the final receiver.  \n   \u2022 This approach keeps the ERP core clean and still fulfils the partner-specific\n     requirement of \u201cone payload that also contains X, Y, Z\u201d.\n\nWhat you cannot do in Public Cloud\n\u2022 Add a new node or a Base64-encoded binary object directly inside the standard XML\n  structure (e.g. an <AdditionalDocumentReference> with an embedded binary) \u2013\n  the XML schema is locked by SAP.  \n\u2022 Implement on-prem BAdIs such as EDOC_ADDITIONAL_INFORMATION_IF or\n  SD_BIL_OUTPUT_PDF \u2013 they are not released in SAP S/4HANA Cloud.  \n\u2022 Modify the Adobe form interface to carry a second binary stream.\n\nTherefore:  \n\u2013 If the receiver of the message is happy with \u201cXML + separate attachment\u201d, use\n  the attachment facet / API and the e-mail option.  \n\u2013 If the receiver insists on \u201cfiles embedded in the same technical message\u201d, wrap\n  them in CPI (or another integration layer) after the XML leaves S/4HANA Cloud.",

    "generated_answer": "Short answer: No \u2013 in SAP S/4HANA Cloud, public edition, the standard Fiori applications \u201cManage Electronic Documents\u201d (F1721) and its predecessor \u201ceDocument Cockpit\u201d are not released for key-user or developer extensibility, therefore you cannot add your own custom field to the UI or to the underlying monitor tables/services.\n\nWhy?\n\n1. No released business context  \n   The app is fed by the CDS view I_EDOCMONITOR (and the corresponding OData service).  \n   This business context is not whitelisted in \u201cCustom Fields & Logic\u201d, so you cannot create a custom field and have SAP add it automatically to the monitor structure.\n\n2. No UI-adaptation extension points  \n   For many list-report apps you can use \u201cAdapt UI\u201d to add an existing, *already delivered* field.  \n   The cockpit/monitor does not offer an extension column nor a flexible column layout that would allow you to bind a new field.\n\n3. No developer extensibility in public cloud  \n   In on-premise / private-cloud you could implement BAdIs such as EDOC_COCKPIT_ATTR or enhance the CDS view and rebuild the Fiori element.  \n   ABAP developer extensibility of that type is not available in the public-cloud edition.\n\nWhat is still possible?\n\n\u2022 You can fill or repurpose the *existing* free-text fields (e.g. Reference Document Number, Note) by means of the released BAdIs that build the eDocument payload.  \n\u2022 You can extend the XML/JSON payload that is sent to the authority by using the mapping-extension BAdIs \u2013 but that information will not appear as an extra column in the monitor.  \n\u2022 If you really need a list report that shows your own field, you must build a separate custom Fiori application on top of the released A2X API \u201cElectronic Document \u2013 Read\u201d (API_EDOC_*) and publish it under your own tile; the standard monitor itself cannot be changed.\n\nTherefore, in the public-cloud system you cannot \u201cextend the Manage Electronic Documents app / eDocument Cockpit app by adding a custom field\u201d; you would have to live with the standard fields or create a standalone custom app that consumes the same eDocument data.",

Contradiction with expert answer: The generated answer states that extending the eDocument Cockpit with a custom field is not supported in SAP S/4HANA Public Cloud, while the expert answer clearly states that it is possible.\n\n2. Inaccuracy regarding customization options: The generated answer claims that customizing activities are not accessible in the public-cloud tenant, which is not true according to the SAP documentation summary. The summary indicates that customers can use the Custom Logic app to implement Business Add-Ins (BAdIs) for customizing the eDocument Cockpit.\n\n3. Misrepresentation of extensibility options: The generated answer incorrectly states that neither key-user extensions nor developer extensibility options can inject additional fields into an existing eDocument process or the \"eDocument Cockpit\" app. However, the SAP documentation summary clearly outlines various BAdIs available for customization, including adding custom fields and logic.\n\n4. Failure to address Spain-specific information: The generated answer does not provide any Spain-specific information, whereas the SAP documentation summary mentions specific BAdIs and processes available for Spain, such as Spain eInvoice (Webservice) and Spain eInvoice (Download).\n\n5. Incorrect conclusion: The generated answer concludes that Public-Cloud customers have to work with the field set delivered by SAP without any possibility of extension, which is directly contradicted by the expert answer and the SAP documentation summary.\n\nIn summary, the generated answer is not helpful as it provides incorrect information and fails to address the user's question accurately.

Preparation\n------------------------------------\n1.1 Find the eDocument process you are going to extend  \n     App: Manage Electronic Documents  \u2794 open any document of the process and note\n        \u2022 Process name   (e.g. MX_EINV, PEPPOL_BILLING \u2026)  \n        \u2022 Document type  (e.g. \u2018FPEL\u2019 \u2018INV\u2019 \u2026)\n\n1.2 Check whether the field already exists  \n     App: Manage Mapping for eDocument \u2794 Display the mapping tree\n     If the field is already available in the Source structure you only need step 5\n     (mapping) \u2013 all other steps can be skipped.\n\n------------------------------------\n2. Create the field in the business object\n------------------------------------\n2.1 \u201cKey user\u201d step \u2013 Custom Fields App  \n     \u2022 Business context that holds the data you need (e.g. SD Billing Document Header).  \n     \u2022 Add your field (YY1_ZPRCTR for example, data element CHAR10).  \n     \u2022 Mark \u201cEnable Usage\u201d \u2013> Electronic Document and (if required) APIs, CDS.  \n     \u2022 Publish.\n\nResult: the field is appended to the relevant database include\n        and to the released CDS view I_BillingDocument*.\n\n------------------------------------\n3. Expose the field in the eDocument extraction CDS view\n------------------------------------\nDone in ADT (Developer Extensibility)\n\n3.1 Create a CDS view extension \u201cyy1_edoc_billing_ext\u201d:\n\n  @EndUserText.label : 'Extension \u2013 add ZPRCTR to I_Edoc_Billing'\n  extend view I_Edoc_Billing\n    with yy1_edoc_billing_ext\n  {\n     _BillingDocument.YY1_ZPRCTR as CustProfitCtr\n  }\n\n\u2022 Only projection-list extensions are allowed in public cloud.  \n\u2022 Activate \u2013 the field is now technically part of the eDocument\n  extraction structure (is_all_edoc_data).\n\n------------------------------------\n4.

Test\n------------------------------------\n6.1 Create / change a billing document (or source object) such that the new\n     field has a value.  \n6.2 Run \u201cCreate eDocument\u201d / schedule the extraction job.  \n6.3 In Manage Electronic Documents display the JSON/XML content \u2192 your field\n     must appear with the correct value.  \n6.4 Send the document; check that the interface to the Peppol Service /\n     E-Invoice Service etc. remains green.\n\n------------------------------------\n7. Transport / Lifecycle\n------------------------------------\n\u2022 Objects created in ADT belong to the cloud transport layer ZLOCAL.  \n  They are moved with the \u201cExport Software Collection\u201d app.  \n\u2022 Mapping changes are collected in the same software collection.  \n\u2022 Key-user custom field is also transported that way.\n\n-------------------------------------------------\nImportant Hints / Troubleshooting\n-------------------------------------------------\n\u2022 A CDS view extension is the ONLY possibility to add fields to the\n  extraction structure in public cloud \u2013 append structures at DDIC\n  level are not allowed.  \n\u2022 Do not change SAP delivered CDS view keys or annotations.  \n\u2022 Every field that shall be mapped must be contained in table\n  IS_ALL_EDOC_DATA (view I_EDOC_ALL); otherwise it is ignored.  \n\u2022 If you do not see your field in the mapping tool, clear the metadata\n  cache in \u201cManage Mapping for eDocument\u201d (button \u2018Regenerate Source\u2019).  \n\u2022 Unit tests: use ABAP Unit in your BAdI class or the Test functionality\n  in \u201cManage Electronic Documents\u201d (simulate extraction only).\n\nBy following the seven steps above you have technically extended the\nstandard eDocument process, populated the new field with business data,\nmade it available in the mapping UI and finally sent it to the external\nauthority \u2013 completely supported in SAP S/4HANA Public Cloud and without\nmodifying any SAP artefact.",

Identify who still needs to work with the cockpit  \n   \u2022 Users that are allowed to create / resend / cancel eDocuments keep the processing role.  \n   \u2022 Everybody else should receive a display-only role.\n\n2. Create a display-only business role\n\n   a) Open the Fiori app \u201cMaintain Business Roles\u201d.  \n   b) Copy the standard role template   \n      SAP_BR_EDOC_PROCESS_PC (or any Z-role you are already using).  \n   c) In the copy, delete the processing catalogue\n      \u2794 remove SAP_FIN_BC_EDOC_PROC_PC.  \n   d) Add the display catalogue\n      \u2794 add SAP_FIN_BC_EDOC_DISP_PC.  \n   e) Save and generate the new role, for example ZBR_EDOC_DISPLAY.\n\n   Result  \n   \u2013 The tile \u201cManage Electronic Documents\u201d (F4825) is still available,  \n   \u2013 But all actions that need the POST, PUT or DELETE OData verbs (Create, Change, Cancel, Send) are removed automatically; the user can only display documents.\n\n3. Assign the new role to the required users\n\n   a) In \u201cMaintain Business Roles\u201d, use the \u201cMaintain Restrictions\u201d button if you would like to restrict further (company code, plant, etc.).  \n   b) Use \u201cMaintain Business Users\u201d (or Import Users CSV) to attach ZBR_EDOC_DISPLAY to the identified employees.\n\n4. (Optional) Hide the processing tiles altogether  \n   If you do not even want the tile to be displayed, do one of the following:\n   \u2022 In \u201cManage Launchpad Pages\u201d remove the card \u201cManage Electronic Documents\u201d from the user\u2019s page and add \u201cDisplay Electronic Documents\u201d (F4852) instead.  \n   \u2022 Or keep the page but set it to \u201cNo Display\u201d in the page or section settings.\n\n5. Transport to Q-system and P-system  \n   Use \u201cExport Software Collection\u201d \u2192 \u201cImport Collection\u201d so the new role reaches the productive tenant.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\nAdditional configuration possibilities (if you want the system itself to stop building eDocuments)\n\nThe authorization restriction explained above is usually sufficient; however, for Spain you can also stop automatic generation for specific document types or company codes:\n\n\u2022 SSCUI 103075 \u201cDefine Document Types Relevant for SII\u201d\n  \u2013 Remove the relevance flag for the FI or SD document types you do not want to report.\n\n\u2022 SSCUI 103077 \u201cDefine Relevance of Company Codes and Document Types\u201d\n  \u2013 Mark a combination as \u201cNot relevant\u201d.  \n  \u2013 The posting will be saved in FI/SD, but the eDocument is never generated, so nothing will appear in the cockpit.\n\n\u2022 Output Parameter Determination \u2013 Billing Document (SSCUI 101024)\n  \u2013 In the CHANNEL determination step, make sure the condition does NOT return EDOC; then no eDocument output is triggered from billing.\n\nThose SSCUIs influence document creation system-wide, not only per user; therefore, use them only if you really must block the entire company code or document type.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\nResult for the Spanish public-cloud customer\n\nAfter the steps above, users who only have the display catalogue can do the following inside the cockpit:\n\n\u2713 Search electronic documents  \n\u2713 View header / item data  \n\u2713 Monitor processing status and error messages  \n\u2717 They cannot press \u201cCreate\u201d, \u201cSend\u201d, \u201cCancel\u201d, \u201cResend\u201d, \u201cRe-process\u201d, \u201cChange\u201d, etc.\n\nHence the creation of an eDocument is effectively restricted without touching code or carrying out any non-cloud-compliant modification.",

This aligns with the expert answer and the additional context from SAP documentation.\n\n2. Completeness: It provides multiple examples of relevant BAdIs (EDOC_ACC_DOCUMENT_FILTER, EDOC_SD_BILLING_FILTER, EDOC_MM_DOCUMENT_FILTER) and explains how to use them, which goes beyond the single example in the expert answer.\n\n3. Implementation details: The answer includes two detailed code examples (for accounting documents and SD billing documents) that demonstrate how to implement the logic. These examples are clear, well-commented, and show how to set the cv_do_not_create parameter, which is crucial for preventing eDocument creation.\n\n4. Step-by-step guidance: The answer provides a clear, step-by-step process for implementing the solution in the Public Cloud tenant using the \"Custom Logic\" Fiori app. This practical guidance is not present in the expert answer and adds significant value.\n\n5. Additional tips: The answer includes useful tips for implementation, such as keeping the code short and using only data passed by the interface or released CDS views/APIs to stay within public cloud restrictions.\n\n6.

Omissions:\n   - The generated answer doesn't provide information about the specific methods and functionalities available for attaching files, such as using the ATTACHMENTS table parameter or the SET_OUTPUT_DATA method of the EDOC_ADAPTOR BAdI.\n\nWhile the generated answer does provide some useful information and alternatives, it misses the core capability of attaching additional files in SAP S/4HANA Cloud, public edition, which is possible through the use of specific BAdIs and methods. This misalignment with both the expert answer and the tool-provided context makes it only partially helpful.",

Activate the BAdIs (only if you created them in step 6 or need additional ones)\n   Typical public-cloud BAdIs:  \n   \u2013 DRC_DATA_RETRIEVAL_EXT  (to influence data selection)  \n   \u2013 DRC_OUTPUT_PARAMETER_DET (to steer file name, receiver ID, etc.)  \n   \u2013 DRC_POSTPROCESSING_EXT   (for post-submission events)\n\n10. Validate and Activate the process\n    Hit the \u201cCheck\u201d button. All mapping lines must be green and at least one Output / File Format must be assigned.  \n    Press \u201cActivate\u201d. From now on the process is visible in the operational apps.\n\n11. Authorize the business users\n    Give the Italian key users the business role SAP_BR_DRC_ANALYST or SAP_BR_DRC_REPORT_SPECIALIST and, if needed, the role that allows \u201cSubmit Statutory Reports\u201d.\n\n12. Test end-to-end\n    a. Open \u201cRun Statutory Reports\u201d or \u201cManage Electronic Documents\u201d.  \n    b. Choose the new process, company code, period.  \n    c. Execute \u2013 verify the preview file.  \n    d. For e-documents -> Submit; for reports -> Download or Submit (depending on what you configured).\n\n13. Transport to the production tenant\n    a. Open \u201cExport Software Collection\u201d, add the Process (customizing object type DRC_PR).  \n    b. Release collection, then import it in the P-system via \u201cImport Collection\u201d.  \n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\nResult\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\nYour Italian customer now has a brand-new DRC process, completely cloud-compliant, which\u2028\n\u2022 extracts the required data through a custom or SAP CDS view,  \n\u2022 maps it in the Extensibility cockpit,  \n\u2022 produces the correct XML/TXT/PDF layout, and  \n\u2022 submits (or stores) the file exactly as requested by the Italian tax authority/SDI.",

    "generated_answer": "The \u201ccountry/region-level handler\u201d is the single ABAP class that the Document and Reporting Compliance (DRC) framework calls whenever it must do something that can vary from one country/region to another (fill specific XML tags, set defaults, do a legal calculation, decide whether a document must be reported, \u2026).  \nIn an SAP S/4HANA Public Cloud system you create that class with developer extensibility (ABAP Cloud) and then tell DRC which class it has to use for which country/region and scenario.  \nThe procedure is therefore always a combination of\n\n1. Development (create the class in ADT and implement the released interface).  \n2. Customizing (assign the class to a country/region and a DRC scenario).  \n\nBelow is the step-by-step cookbook that SAP gives in their extensibility guide.\n\n\n\n=====================================================\n1. Prerequisites\n=====================================================\n\n\u2022 Your tenant is enabled for \u201cDeveloper Extensibility\u201d (Embedded Steampunk).  \n\u2022 You have the business catalog SAP_CORE_BC_EXT_DEV (role SAP_BR_DEVELOPER) and a software component in the customer namespace (Z\u2026 or YY1\u2026).  \n\u2022 You know the DRC scenario for which you want to add logic (for example: E_DOCUMENT, VAT_REPORTING, ICMS_BR, etc.).  \n\u2022 You have the released interface name that the framework expects.  For country/region handlers the interface is IF_DRC_EX_CTY_HANDLER (from S4CORE) \u2013 all countries use the same interface.\n\n=====================================================\n2. Create the package and the class (ADT/Eclipse)\n=====================================================\n\n01. In ADT choose File \u25b6 New \u25b6 ABAP Package \u2192  \n    \u2022 Name: Z_DRC_EXT  \n    \u2022 Type: Development  \n    \u2022 Software component: ZLOCAL (or the customer software component you got)  \n    \u2022 Transport layer: $TMP (or a real transport if you already have a route).\n\n02. Inside the package create a new ABAP class  \n    \u2022 Name: ZCL_DRC_FR_HANDLER          (example for France)  \n    \u2022 Description: Country-level handler \u2013 France  \n    \u2022 Final / Public / Instantiable  \n    \u2022 Add interface IF_DRC_EX_CTY_HANDLER in the \u201cInterfaces\u201d field.  \n      ADT automatically adds the following methods that you must implement:\n\n       \u2013 IF_DRC_EX_CTY_HANDLER~GET_VERSION  \n       \u2013 IF_DRC_EX_CTY_HANDLER~IS_ACTIVE  \n       \u2013 IF_DRC_EX_CTY_HANDLER~FILL_HEADER_DATA  \n       \u2013 IF_DRC_EX_CTY_HANDLER~FILL_ITEM_DATA  \n       \u2013 IF_DRC_EX_CTY_HANDLER~BEFORE_SERIALIZE  \n       \u2013 IF_DRC_EX_CTY_HANDLER~AFTER_SERIALIZE  \n       \u2013 \u2026 (the list can change slightly with new releases \u2011 implement what the wizard proposes).\n\n03.

    "generated_answer": "Short answer  \nNo \u2013 in the public-cloud edition of SAP S/4HANA you cannot create your own ABAP class to change or enhance Document & Reporting Compliance (DRC) process mapping. Public-cloud tenants only let you use the DRC functions that SAP has released for key-user or developer extensibility, and at the moment SAP has not released any BAdI, interface or API that would allow you to plug in a self-written ABAP class for process mapping.  \n\nWhy it does not work  \n\n1. Extensibility model  \n   \u2022 Key-user (in-app) extensibility = Custom Fields, Custom Logic BAdIs, etc.  \n   \u2022 Developer (embedded Steampunk) extensibility = ABAP Cloud classes but only on released APIs.  \n   \u2022 Side-by-side on SAP BTP.  \n\n2. What DRC exposes today in public cloud  \n   \u2022 Configuration apps (Process Settings, Determination tables, Assign content, etc.).  \n   \u2022 Few key-user BAdIs (e.g. ACR_DOC_VALIDATION, ACR_DOC_ENRICHMENT) \u2013 none of them covers \u201cProcess Mapping\u201d.  \n   \u2022 No released ABAP interface, global class, CDS view or RAP facet for the process-mapping step. Therefore ABAP Cloud code cannot legally call or redefine anything in that area.  \n\n3. Public-cloud guard rails  \n   \u2022 You cannot create new repository objects that are not on the released whitelist.  \n   \u2022 Customer-specific subclasses of SAP internal classes (CL_ACR_DCS_PROCESS_MAPPING* in on-prem) are forbidden because those classes are not released in public cloud.  \n\nWhat you can do instead  \n\n\u2022 Try to achieve the required mapping by configuration (Manage Process Settings, output parameter determination).  \n\u2022 Use the key-user BAdIs that are available for document enrichment/validation if they solve your need.  \n\u2022 If you definitely need an own ABAP implementation of the mapping logic you have to run DRC in S/4HANA private-cloud or on-prem (where the enhancement spots and exit classes are open) or build the extra logic side-by-side on SAP BTP and call DRC via the public APIs.  \n\nTherefore, with the current 23xx/24xx public-cloud releases the creation of an ABAP class for DRC process mapping is not supported.",

It aligns well with the expert answer and provides additional detailed steps and considerations. Here's why it's fully helpful:\n\n1. It correctly identifies the BAdI as EDOCUMENT_BASE_EXT and its purpose for enriching the XML sent to the Spanish tax authority (SII).\n\n2. The steps provided are more detailed and specific to the cloud environment than the expert answer, which is appropriate for the public cloud edition.\n\n3. It includes prerequisites, such as the required system, business scope, and user role, which are crucial for implementation in the cloud environment.\n\n4. The procedure is well-structured and includes important steps like creating custom fields, implementing the BAdI using the \"Custom Logic\" app, writing ABAP logic (with code examples), and transporting to Q and P systems.\n\n5. It provides specific details for Spain, such as examples of what to add (e.g., \"Clave R\u00e9gimen Especial\", \"Factura Sustitutiva\").\n\n6. The answer includes troubleshooting and logging information, which is not mentioned in the expert answer but is valuable for implementation and maintenance.\n\n7. It emphasizes key points specific to the Public Cloud environment, such as using in-app extensibility tools and restricted ABAP.\n\nWhile the expert answer provides a more generic approach, the generated answer tailors the implementation specifically for SAP S/4HANA Cloud, public edition, and for Spain, making it more directly applicable and comprehensive for the given scenario.",

    "generated_answer": "In SAP S/4HANA Cloud, public edition, every customer enhancement \u2013 including the one that is needed to enrich the XML that is sent to the Spanish tax authority (SII) \u2013 has to be done with the in-app extensibility tools.  \nThe BAdI that SAP delivers for this purpose is \u00adEDOCUMENT_BASE_EXT.  \nThe procedure below follows the sequence that SAP Product Assistance and SAP Note 3090501 describe and has already been used in live Spanish Cloud projects.\n\nPrerequisites  \n\u2022 System: SAP S/4HANA Cloud, public edition (3-system landscape).  \n\u2022 Business scope: J58 (Document Compliance \u2013 Spain, SII).  \n\u2022 User role: SAP_BR_EXTENSIBILITY_DEVELOPER or equivalent.\n\nStep-by-step procedure\n\n1. Decide what you have to add or change  \n   \u2013 Typical Spanish examples are \u201cClave R\u00e9gimen Especial\u201d, \u201cFactura Sustitutiva\u201d, \u201cFactura Recapitulativa\u201d, etc.  \n   \u2013 If the value does not yet exist in the source document, create a custom field first.\n\n2. (Optional) Create the custom field(s)  \n   a. Open app \u201cCustom Fields\u201d.  \n   b. Business context e.g. \u201cSales: Billing Document \u2013 Header\u201d or \u201cSales: Billing Document \u2013 Item\u201d.  \n   c. Add the field, keep \u201cEnable Usage\u201d in \u201cOData\u201d and \u201cWrite\u201d checked.  \n   d. Publish.  \n   The field will automatically be appended (YY1_\u2026) to the extension include that the BAdI can read.\n\n3. Implement the BAdI with the \u201cCustom Logic\u201d app  \n   a. Launch \u201cCustom Logic\u201d.  \n   b. Create \u2192 New.  \n      \u2013 Business Context: \u201cElectronic Document Base Extension\u201d  \n      \u2013 BAdI: EDOCUMENT_BASE_EXT  \n      \u2013 Implementation description: e.g. \u201cES \u2013 enrich header for SII\u201d.  \n   c. Maintain filter values (important, otherwise the logic is executed for every country):  \n      \u2013 Company Code = ESxx (your Spanish companies)  \n      \u2013 EDocument Type  = \u2018SII\u2019 (or leave blank and check I_EDOC_PROCESS_ID inside the code).  \n   d. Choose \u201cAPI state = Unrestricted\u201d.  \n   e. Press Create.\n\n4. Write the ABAP logic (restricted ABAP)  \n   The BAdI contains three methods; for SII you normally use the first two:\n\n   METHOD if_edocument_base_ext~fill_edoc_header.  \n\n     \"Read billing header extension incl. custom fields  \n     SELECT SINGLE * FROM vbrk                         \"Billing header  \n          WHERE vbeln = @is_doc_object-key_vbeln  \n          INTO @DATA(ls_vbrk).\n\n     \"Example: fill Special Regime Code from custom field YY1_REGIMECODE_ES  \n     IF ls_vbrk-yy1_regimecode_es IS NOT INITIAL.  \n       cs_edoc_header-edi_es_regime_code = ls_vbrk-yy1_regimecode_es.  \n     ENDIF.\n\n   ENDMETHOD.\n\n   METHOD if_edocument_base_ext~fill_edoc_item.\n\n     LOOP AT ct_edoc_item ASSIGNING FIELD-SYMBOL(<ls_item>).  \n       \"Read item data (or use the already imported structure)  \n       SELECT SINGLE * FROM vbrp  \n              WHERE vbeln = @is_doc_object-key_vbeln  \n                AND posnr = @<ls_item>-item_no  \n              INTO @DATA(ls_vbrp).\n\n       \"Example: set Indicator for \u2018Entrega Gratuita\u2019 from custom field  \n       IF ls_vbrp-yy1_freegoods_es = abap_true.  \n         <ls_item>-edi_es_freegoods_ind = 'S'.        \"S\u00ed  \n       ENDIF.  \n     ENDLOOP.\n\n   ENDMETHOD.\n\n   METHOD if_edocument_base_ext~modify_edoc_prop.  \n     \"Only if you have to change properties such as document subtype.  \n   ENDMETHOD.\n\n   f. Syntax Check \u2192 Save \u2192 Publish.\n\n5. Transport to Q-system and P-system  \n   \u2013 After the implementation is \u2018Published\u2019 in the development tenant, include it in a software collection and release/transport in the usual Cloud way (Export Software Collection).\n\n6. Test the enhancement  \n   a. Create or change a billing document.  \n   b. Open the app \u201cSubmit eDocument\u201d (Spain SII) or schedule job \u201cGenerate and Submit eDocuments \u2013 Spain\u201d.  \n   c. In the \u201cMonitor eDocuments\u201d app open the XML preview.  \n   d. Verify that the nodes you enriched (R\u00e9gimen, TipoFactura, etc.) now contain the expected values.\n\n7. Troubleshooting & Logs  \n   \u2013 Use app \u201cApplication Log\u201d (Object EDOCUMENT, Subobject ES_SII).  \n   \u2013 The runtime message will show whether the BAdI ran and which values were finally transferred.\n\nKey points to remember for Public Cloud\n\n\u2022 All electronic-document extensions must go through the in-app tool \u201cCustom Logic\u201d; SPRO/SE19 is not available.  \n\u2022 Restrict your logic with filters (company code, process ID) to avoid affecting other countries.  \n\u2022 Only released ABAP artefacts can be used; use CDS views or public interfaces, no direct SELECT on internal tables that are not whitelisted.  \n\u2022 After every new release (upgrade) retest the BAdI \u2013 field catalogues for SII are sometimes extended by SAP.\n\nBy following the steps above you implement BAdI EDOCUMENT_BASE_EXT in S/4HANA Cloud, public edition, enabling Spanish customer-specific information to be added to the SII XML without modification of the SAP standard.",

    "generated_answer": "In the DRC (Document & Reporting Compliance) framework every piece of legislation that is handled \u2013 an electronic invoice, an electronic transport document, a sales-listing file, etc. \u2013 is processed as an \u201ceDocument\u201d.  \nThe system therefore needs one master key that tells DRC:\n\n\u2022 what kind of legal document this is,  \n\u2022 where the data come from (FI, SD, MM \u2026),  \n\u2022 which mapping/transformation rules have to run,  \n\u2022 which communication scenario (PEPPOL, web-service, file, API \u2026) has to be used,  \n\u2022 which statuses have to be shown in the monitor,  \n\u2022 which enhancement points (BAdIs, RAP actions, AIF checks) are active for it.\n\nThat master key is the eDocument Type.\n\nWhy you must create a new eDocument Type when you build your own process with DRC extensibility\n\n1. Separation from SAP-delivered content  \n   \u2013 SAP ships the standard eDocument Types that belong to delivered localisations.  \n   \u2013 By creating your own (usually starting with \u201cZ\u201d), you keep your custom scenario isolated and upgrade-safe.\n\n2. Customising container  \n   All subsequent Customising or CBC steps are made \u201cper eDocument Type\u201d: mapping profile, determination object, output channel, monitor layout, AIF interface, status scheme, etc. Without the type you have no place to store these settings.\n\n3. Runtime steering  \n   At runtime the framework reads the eDocument Type that the application (SD billing, FI posting, MM PO \u2026) passed to it.  \n   Based on that key the system decides which processing class, BAdIs, validation profile, service endpoint, etc., it must call.  \n   If you reused an SAP type, you would either break the SAP scenario or your own.\n\n4. Legal traceability  \n   Authorities usually require different reference numbering, archives, signature keys and submission endpoints per obligation. Those elements are all linked to the eDocument Type.\n\n5. Monitor and error handling  \n   The DRC Monitor groups and filters documents by their eDocument Type. Creating your own type gives you a dedicated tile or variant where users see only the documents of your new process and the status texts that belong to it.\n\nIn short: the eDocument Type is the anchor that binds together the source business document, the mapping logic, the communication arrangement, the status management and the user interface for one specific legal process. Therefore the very first step when you create a new DRC scenario in SAP S/4HANA Cloud is to create (copy) and adapt an eDocument Type.",

Keep the XML unchanged and send the extra file next to it  \n   \u2022 Implement the BAdI for the channel you are using (e-mail, EDI, web service, RFC, \u2026).  \n     The most frequently used ones are  \n       \u2013 APOC_OUTPUT_EMAIL_BADI  (e-mail channel)  \n       \u2013 SD_BIL_OUTPUT           (billing)  \n       \u2013 PUR_SE_OUTPUT_CONTROL   (purchasing)  \n   \u2022 In method ADD_ATTACHMENT (or a similarly-named method) you read the binary of the additional file, fill structure SATTACHMENT (filename, MIME type, binary content) and append it to the CT_ATTACHMENT table that the framework passes back to the caller.  \n   \u2022 Result: the XML that SAP produces stays 100 % standard, but the receiver gets the XML plus the additional file in the same MIME message / e-mail.\n\n2. Embed the file content inside the XML (only possible if the XML format actually has a place for it, e.g. UBL\u2019s AdditionalDocumentReference-/EmbeddedDocumentBinaryObject)  \n   \u2022 Copy SAP\u2019s XSLT transformation that is used to build the XML (transaction STRANS) or implement the BAdI EDOC_ADJUST_XML_\u2026 that exists for most electronic-document formats.  \n   \u2022 Extend the copied XSLT or fill the corresponding BAdI parameter so that the binary of your file is base-64-encoded and written into the right XML element.  \n   \u2022 Activate the copy of the transformation / your BAdI implementation in Customizing \u2192 Output Management \u2192 Assign Form Templates / XML Programs.  \n   \u2022 Result: you still send exactly one XML file, but it now also contains the embedded attachment in base-64 format.  \n     (Keep an eye on size; many networks limit a single XML to 5\u201310 MB.)\n\nWhat will NOT work  \n\u2022 A purely \u201cconfiguration-only\u201d solution (there is none).  \n\u2022 Doing it in the public-cloud edition (no ABAP enhancement points there).  \n\u2022 Modifying the standard repository objects directly (copy them and register the copy, otherwise they will be overwritten by an upgrade).\n\nIn short: in the private-cloud system you can attach additional files, but you must use one of the enhancement spots listed above and add the file either (a) as a separate MIME/-e-mail attachment or (b) as base-64 data inside a suitable XML element.",

Preparation  \n   \u2022 Make sure the Greek eDocument solution is activated and the latest SAP Notes for myDATA are in the system.  \n   \u2022 Get Eclipse with ABAP Development Tools (ADT) and create an ABAP-Cloud project that points to the PCE system.\n\n2. Create the enhancement implementation in ADT  \n   2.1 In the Project Explorer choose:  \n       Repository Browser \u2192 Enhancement Spots \u2192 EDOC_GREECE_XML  \n   2.2 Right-mouse \u2192 \u201cCreate BAdI Implementation\u201d.  \n       Give the implementation a Z-name, for example Z_GR_XML_ENHANCE, put it in a customer package and transport request.  \n   2.3 Depending on what you want to do pick the correct interface:  \n       \u2022 IF_EDOC_XML_MODIFY   \u2013 to change the content of existing nodes.  \n       \u2022 IF_EDOC_XML_EXTEND   \u2013 to append completely new nodes/attributes.  \n\n3. Implement the method in the generated class  \n   The relevant method is MODIFY_XML (or EXTEND_XML).  \n   Example skeleton:\n\n   METHOD if_edoc_xml_modify~modify_xml.          \" or ~extend_xml\n     DATA: lx_doc     TYPE xstring,\n           lx_new_doc TYPE xstring.\n\n     \"Original XML is delivered in iv_xml\n     lx_doc = iv_xml.\n\n     \"Run an XSLT or Simple-Transform to add/change nodes\n     CALL TRANSFORMATION z_gr_mydata_enhance\n       SOURCE xml = lx_doc\n       RESULT xml = lx_new_doc.\n\n     \"Return manipulated XML to the framework\n     cv_xml = lx_new_doc.\n   ENDMETHOD.\n\n   \u2022 You may also build/modify the XML with DOM or SAX if you prefer.  \n   \u2022 Do not forget to keep the namespace and the schema location intact.\n\n4. Activate and transport the implementation\n\n5. Test the enhancement  \n   \u2022 Go to eDocument Cockpit (transaction EDOC_COCKPIT).  \n   \u2022 Create a test document, choose \u201cPreview XML\u201d \u2013 the extra information you coded must be visible.  \n   \u2022 When the document is finally sent, the Adapter picks up exactly this XML; nothing overwrites it afterwards.\n\n6. Productive usage  \n   When QA tests are successful, import the transport into the productive tenant; the BAdI runs automatically for every Greek eDocument that is generated and the XML that leaves the system already contains your additions.\n\nKey points to remember  \n\u2022 You never touch SAP standard artefacts; everything goes through the delivered BAdI.  \n\u2022 The BAdI is executed at the very last moment, therefore anything you add or change is what AADE (Greek Tax Authority) receives.  \n\u2022 All development work is done with ADT (Eclipse) because classic SE80 modifications are not permitted in Private Cloud.",

Decide whether an own action is really required\n--------------------------------------------------\n\u2022 Use a new action only if the logic cannot be covered by:\n  \u2013 The standard \u201cEXECUTE BAdI in action\u201d option, or\n  \u2013 One of the delivered SAP actions that can be called from your\n    Z-process step.  \n\u2022 Remember: never change SAP entries; always create Z* entries.\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n2. Create the implementation class for the action\n--------------------------------------------------\n1. In ADT (or SE24) create a class in the customer namespace\n   (ZCL_EDOC_ACTION_XXX).  \n2. Either:\n   \u2022 Inherit from CL_EDOC_ACTION_BASE and redefine\n     method DO_EXECUTE, or\n   \u2022 Implement interface IF_EDOC_ACTION completely.\n3. Inside DO_EXECUTE / IF_EDOC_ACTION~EXECUTE you receive the table\n   ct_edoc_header with the selected eDocuments.  \n   \u2013 Build your own logic (create files, call an external web service,\n     set new status, write messages, etc.).  \n   \u2013 Use CL_EDOC_MESSAGE_HANDLER=>ADD_MESSAGE for cockpit messages.  \n4. If you need test runs, also redefine\n   IF_EDOC_ACTION~EXECUTE_SIMULATE.  \n5. Activate and transport the class.\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n3. Create the action in Customising\n--------------------------------------------------\nIMG path:\n  Cross-Application Components  \n  \u2192 Document Compliance  \n  \u2192 eDocument Cockpit  \n  \u2192 Maintain Actions\n\nFill the fields:\n\n  Action                   : ZMY_ACTION  \n  Description              : My new validation action  \n  Implementation Class     : ZCL_EDOC_ACTION_XXX  \n  Exec.

Select your custom Process ID (ZPROCESS).  \n2. Go to the \u201cProcess Steps\u201d node; create or pick the step to which the\n   new action belongs (e.g. ZSTEP_VALIDATE).  \n3. In the \u201cAssigned Actions\u201d sub-view add ZMY_ACTION and set the\n   execution sequence number (the lower the number, the earlier it is\n   offered).  \n4.

Expose the action in the UI (cockpit button)\n--------------------------------------------------\n1. Call transaction /EDOCUMENT/CUST_UI  (or table maintenance view\n   V_EDOC_UI_ACTN).  \n2. Create an entry for:\n   \u2013 Process ID   : ZPROCESS  \n   \u2013 Action       : ZMY_ACTION  \n   \u2013 Button Text  : Validate  \n   \u2013 Icon         : sap-icon://check  \n   \u2013 Sequence     : 40 (decides where the button appears)  \n3. Save and transport.\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n6. Authorisation\n--------------------------------------------------\nAdd the action to the authorisation object EDOC_ACT (or the role used in\nPFCG) so that the end-user can execute it.\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n7. Testing\n--------------------------------------------------\n1. Create or pick a business document that is linked to your\n   eDocument-process and generate the eDocument.  \n2.

    "generated_answer": "Short answer  \nNo \u2013 neither the \u201cManage Electronic Documents\u201d Fiori app (F1671/F1984) nor the legacy Web-Dynpro \u201ceDocument Cockpit\u201d can be enhanced with additional fields in SAP S/4HANA Cloud, private edition. SAP has deliberately locked these compliance-relevant UIs against key-user or developer UI extensions.  \n\nWhy this restriction exists  \n1. Legal compliance \u2013 The apps belong to the \u201cSAP Document Compliance\u201d framework. SAP must guarantee that every delivered screen, field and process stays consistent with the country-specific legal templates shipped in Support Packages.  \n2. No Business Context \u2013 In the Custom Fields & Logic tool there is no \u201ceDocument\u201d (EDOC) business context. Without a context you cannot create a custom field that can be switched on for the app.  \n3. UI adaptation flag \u2013 Both apps are shipped with the \u201cUI adaptation not allowed\u201d flag. Hence Visual Adaptation, Adapt UI, Web-Dynpro configuration, or UI5 flexibility changes are rejected.  \n4. Modification versus extensibility \u2013 Private-edition does allow modifications, but any change in SAP namespace would put the system into \u201cmodified\u201d status, break the compliance content and make all future SP/SFP updates a manual retrofit. SAP therefore does not support it.\n\nWhat you still CAN do  \n\u2022 Add your own fields to the electronic document payload by means of the provided eDocument BAdIs (e.g. EDOC_ADAPTOR_BADI, EDOC_OUTPUT_MAPPING, etc.) so the legal XML / IDoc / PEPPOL message receives the extra data.  \n\u2022 Build your own custom report/Fiori app that reads the EDOC_* tables or the CDS View I_ElectronicDocument to display your additional fields next to the SAP data.  \n\u2022 Use standard extensibility (CFL, CDS view extension, custom APIs) for the originating business object (billing document, purchase order, etc.), not for the cockpit itself.\n\nBottom line  \nIn S/4HANA Cloud, private edition the standard cockpit UIs are fixed; you may not insert, hide or rearrange fields in them. Any additional business information has to be handled outside the cockpit (via BAdIs, custom reports or custom Fiori apps).",

    "agent_judge_reasoning": "The generated answer is partially helpful in addressing the question about controlling the visibility of Electronic Documents with custom fields in Private Cloud using DRC extensibility. Here's the reasoning:\n\n1. Accuracy: The generated answer correctly states that DRC extensibility can be used to create additional header/item fields, fill those fields using BAdIs, and map them to XML/JSON/PDF sent to tax authorities. This aligns with the information from the SAP documentation summary.\n\n2. Visibility Control: The answer correctly mentions that the standard visibility of electronic documents is controlled by normal SAP authorization objects evaluating standard fields. This is consistent with the information from both sources.\n\n3. Custom Fields and Visibility: The generated answer states that custom fields added through DRC-extensibility BAdIs cannot be used to hide or show documents. However, the SAP documentation summary suggests that there are some capabilities for controlling visibility using custom fields, at least in the Public Cloud environment.\n\n4. Private Cloud Specifics: The generated answer doesn't differentiate between Private Cloud and Public Cloud capabilities, which is a limitation. The SAP Help lookup also doesn't provide specific information about Private Cloud, but it does mention that the extensibility options are applicable to both cloud and on-premise environments, including private cloud deployments.\n\n5. Alternative Solutions: The answer provides alternative solutions, such as using existing authorization objects or developing a custom CDS view/Fiori list report. While these suggestions are reasonable, they don't fully explore the extensibility options mentioned in the SAP Help lookup, such as RAP business object extensions or service definition extensions.\n\n6. Omissions: The answer doesn't mention some of the extensibility capabilities outlined in the SAP Help lookup, such as the Custom Function interface or the ability to extend the Manage Electronic Documents app (F4306).\n\nIn conclusion, while the generated answer provides some accurate information and alternative solutions, it doesn't fully capture the extensibility capabilities available in SAP S/4HANA, particularly in the context of Private Cloud. It also makes a definitive statement about the inability to control visibility using custom fields, which may not be entirely accurate given the information from the SAP documentation summary about visibility control in CDS-based UIs.",

Alignment with Official Information: The sap_documentation_summary tool provided extensive information about DRC Cloud Edition licensing and extensibility options. Nowhere in this official documentation is there any mention of ways to bypass the license. The generated answer correctly refrains from providing any such information.\n\n3. Consistency with Expert Answer: The expert answer also states that there is no information available on bypassing the DRC Cloud Edition license. The generated answer is consistent with this expert assessment.\n\n4.

    "generated_answer": "In the Electronic Document Processing (EDP) framework the development of a brand-new electronic-document process is always carried out in the same order \u2013 first you create the \u201cskeleton\u201d of the process with configuration activities, then you supply the individual steps with ABAP-cloud code, and finally you set-up the communication and test.  \nThe complete procedure in an SAP S/4HANA Public-Cloud system looks as follows:\n\n1. Analyse & design  \n   \u2022 Clarify legal requirement (XML/JSON schema, envelope, acknowledgement flow, communication protocol).  \n   \u2022 Decide whether the process is outbound (for example, an e-invoice) or inbound (for example, an e-purchase-order).  \n   \u2022 Identify the SAP business object that will trigger the process (billing document, FI posting, purchase order \u2026).\n\n2. Create the process shell  \n   App/SSCUI: Configure Your Solution \u2192 Finance \u2192 General Settings \u2192 Electronic Document Processing \u2192 \u201cDefine Electronic Document Processes\u201d.  \n   \u2022 Choose New, enter a Process ID, country/region, direction, usage (Billing, FI, MM, SD \u2026) and keep the status \u201cIn Preparation\u201d.  \n   \u2022 The framework automatically delivers the four technical steps Source \u2192 Convert \u2192 (Send / Receive) \u2192 Post-process; you only decide which of them you really need.\n\n3. Supply the Source step (collect data from SAP)  \n   a. In ADT / ABAP Cloud create a BAdI implementation for enhancement spot EDP_SOURCE_DATA (interface IF_EDP_SOURCE).  \n   b. Fill method GET_DATA with the code that reads the business document and returns it in the EDP source structure.  \n   c. App/SSCUI \u201cDefine Sources\u201d \u2013 create an entry, point to the BAdI implementation, set it to Active.  \n   d. App/SSCUI \u201cAssign Sources to Process\u201d \u2013 link the source entry to your process (sequence 10).\n\n4. Supply the Convert step (map SAP data to the exchange format)  \n   Option 1 \u2013 XSLT: upload the XSLT in ADT Repository \u2192 App \u201cDefine Transformations\u201d \u2192 reference the XSLT.  \n   Option 2 \u2013 ABAP: implement BAdI EDP_TRANSFORM (IF_EDP_TRANSFORM).  \n   Finally assign the transformation to the process (sequence 20).\n\n5. Supply the Adapter step (send or receive the payload)  \n   a. Outbound \u2192 implement BAdI EDP_ADAPTER_OUT; Inbound \u2192 implement BAdI EDP_ADAPTER_IN.  \n   b. Code the HTTP/SOAP/REST call or RFC to SAP Integration Suite, PEPPOL Access Point etc., map the response back to the EDP framework.  \n   c. \u201cDefine Adapters\u201d \u2013 register the BAdI implementation.  \n   d. \u201cAssign Adapters to Process\u201d \u2013 add the adapter as sequence 30 (SEND) or 10 (RECEIVE) depending on direction.\n\n6. (Optional) Post-processing step  \n   If you have to update the original business document with the external status, print a PDF, archive the XML etc., implement BAdI EDP_POSTPROC and assign it as the last step (sequence 40).\n\n7. Finalise and activate the process  \n   \u2022 In \u201cChange Electronic Document Process\u201d set the status to Active.  \n   \u2022 In \u201cAssign Electronic Document Processes to Company Codes\u201d select the plants/company codes that shall use the new process.  \n   \u2022 Transport the configuration (CBC transport) to test/prod tenants.\n\n8. Create communication artefacts  \n   \u2022 Create a Communication Scenario (if none exists), Communication System and Communication Arrangement for the endpoint that the adapter calls.  \n   \u2022 If a middle-ware is required, deploy or extend an iFlow in SAP Integration Suite and use its URL/user in the arrangement.\n\n9. Test and monitor  \n   \u2022 Use the \u201cElectronic Document Test Cockpit\u201d to generate test data and launch the framework.  \n   \u2022 Monitor the result in the \u201cElectronic Documents\u201d app \u2013 you can inspect the internal log, download the generated XML/JSON, and view acknowledgements.  \n   \u2022 Correct issues, repeat until the process finishes in status Completed.\n\n10. Release to business users  \n    \u2022 Add the process to output determination / message control or to the inbound interface so that it is executed automatically.  \n    \u2022 Teach users how to monitor the documents in the standard \u201cElectronic Documents\u201d monitor.\n\nThese ten activities \u2013 create process, add source, add transformation, add adapter, optional post-processing, activate, communicate, test, and release \u2013 are the mandatory steps every time you develop a new electronic-document process in the EDP framework in SAP S/4HANA Public Cloud.",

It correctly identifies and addresses both issues mentioned in the question: the currency code ID showing plant code and the tax exemption reason error (CF366).\n\n2. It provides a detailed explanation of the root cause, accurately describing that the mapping rule for the currencyID attribute of TaxAmount was changed inadvertently, causing the system to fill the plant code instead of the currency code.\n\n3. The answer offers a step-by-step solution to correct the issues, including how to restore the correct mapping for the currency ID and how to provide a tax exemption reason.\n\n4. It includes specific transaction codes (EDOC_AD, SM30) and field names (BKPF-WAERS) that align with SAP documentation and best practices.\n\n5. The answer provides two options for fixing the tax exemption reason issue, including a quick fix and a preferred method using a function (EDOC_GET_TAX_EXEMPTION_REASON).\n\n6. It mentions relevant SAP Notes (3407545, 3398124, 3318505) for further reference, which is consistent with SAP's documentation practices.\n\n7. The generated answer goes beyond the initial question by explaining the related tax exemption reason error, which is valuable for solving the overall issue.\n\n8. The solution provided is detailed, actionable, and aligns with the information from the SAP documentation summary and troubleshooting search results.\n\nIn conclusion, the generated answer fully addresses the user's question, provides accurate technical details, and offers a comprehensive solution to the problem.

    "generated_answer": "Root-cause   \nThe validation message CF366 is raised by the Malaysian LHDN pre-submission validator whenever a tax line that is NOT liable to GST (rate = 0 % / category \u201cE\u201d, \u201cG\u201d, \u201cZ\u201d, \u2026) is sent without the element\n\u2003\u2003/Invoice/TaxTotal/TaxSubtotal/TaxCategory/TaxExemptionReasonCode.  \nBecause the mapping rule that should populate this element is currently wrong, the XML is created with a missing value.  \nAt the same time the mapping rule for the attribute currencyID of TaxAmount was changed inadvertently, therefore the system is filling the plant (P001, KL01 \u2026) instead of the currency code (MYR).  \n\nWhat happened in your system  \n\u2022 In view EDOC_CUST_MAP (or transaction EDOC_AD) you have either copied the SAP standard variant 0001 to Z001 or changed the delivered entry.  \n\u2022 XPath  /Invoice/TaxTotal/TaxAmount@currencyID               is mapped to field EDOC_I-PLANT (WERKS) and not to the document currency (BKPF-WAERS or BSEG-WAERS).  \n\u2022 XPath  /Invoice/TaxTotal/TaxSubtotal/TaxCategory/TaxExemptionReasonCode is empty (no rule maintained -> node is omitted).  \n\nBecause of that the XML that you can download from eDOC_COCKPIT shows for the first tax line e.g.\n\n<TaxSubtotal>  \n   <TaxableAmount currencyID=\"P001\">100.00</TaxableAmount>  \n   <TaxAmount   currencyID=\"P001\"> 0.00</TaxAmount>        \u2190 wrong currency  \n   <TaxCategory>  \n       <ID>S</ID>  \n       <Percent>0</Percent>  \n       <!-- TaxExemptionReasonCode is missing -->  \n   </TaxCategory>  \n</TaxSubtotal>\n\nand the GSP/LHDN validator returns\n\nCF366 \u2013 \u201cTax exemption reason is required\u201d.\n\nHow to correct it  \n\n1. Restore the correct mapping for the currency ID  \n   a) Call transaction EDOC_AD (or SM30 \u2192 view EDOC_CUST_MAP).  \n   b) Choose Object \u201cMYINV\u201d (Malaysia Invoice) and Mapping Variant 0001 (or your Z-variant).  \n   c) Locate the entry with XPath \u2026TaxTotal/TaxAmount@currencyID as well as \u2026TaxableAmount@currencyID.  \n   d) Change \u201cRule Type\u201d to FIELD and map to table BKPF, field WAERS (document currency) \u2013 or use CONSTANT = \u2018MYR\u2019 if you always invoice in MYR.  \n   e) Save.\n\n2. Provide a tax-exemption reason  \n   Option A \u2013 constant value (quick fix)  \n       \u2022 In the same view insert a line (or change the existing empty line) for XPath  \n         /Invoice/TaxTotal/TaxSubtotal/TaxCategory/TaxExemptionReasonCode  \n       \u2022 Rule type = CONSTANT  \n       \u2022 Value      = one of the allowed codes, e.g. \u201cE\u201d (Exempt) or \u201cZ\u201d (ZeroRated) according to LHDN list.  \n       \u2022 Save.\n\n   Option B \u2013 derive reason automatically (preferred)  \n       \u2022 Rule type  = FUNCTION  \n       \u2022 Function   = EDOC_GET_TAX_EXEMPTION_REASON (delivered by SAP note 3407545)  \n       \u2022 The function evaluates the tax code in BSET/J_1BTAX to return the proper reason.  \n\n3. Regenerate and resubmit the document  \n   \u2022 In EDOC_COCKPIT mark the document 5100000296 2024 \u2192 More \u2192 Regenerate XML.  \n   \u2022 Check the new XML (Display \u2192 Show XML) \u2013 TaxAmount currencyID must be \u201cMYR\u201d and TaxExemptionReasonCode must be present.  \n   \u2022 Submit again. The document should now pass without CF366.\n\n4. Transport the changes to QAS/PRD systems.\n\nReference SAP Notes  \n\u2022 3407545 \u2013 Malaysia e-Invoice: Tax exemption reason CF366  \n\u2022 3398124 \u2013 Malaysia e-Invoice: Field mapping delivered by SAP  \n\u2022 3318505 \u2013 eDocument Framework: How to maintain field mapping with EDOC_AD.  \n\nAfter these corrections the currency will always be a valid ISO code and the tax exemption reason will be filled whenever the tax rate is 0 %; the authority error CF366 disappears.",

    "generated_answer": "Hello,\n\nroot cause\n---------- \nThe coding that was shipped with SAP-Notes 3496530 / 3496562 only recognises MM\ndocuments that belong to the \u201cInvoice\u201d (IV) flow.  \nWhen you post a Subsequent Credit (transaction MIRO, value \u2018CR\u2019) the new\nroutine CL_EDO_MY_MM_APPL_CHECK=>GET_IV_TYPE determines the IV-TYPE by reading\nfield RBKP-BLART / RBKP-WAERS and expects value \u2018IV\u2019.  \nBecause \u201cCR\u201d (Credit Note) is not contained in the CASE statement that was\ndelivered with the note, the routine returns INITIAL.  \nAs a consequence the framework assumes that this FI document is not relevant\nfor the Malaysian eInvoice scenario and no entry is written to table\nEDO_MY_DOC (=> nothing is displayed in EDOC_COCKPIT).\n\nThe same check is executed when you cancel a document with MR8M, therefore a\ncancellation credit memo is also ignored.\n\ncorrection\n----------\nSAP will deliver an updated correction note.  \nUntil then you can implement the following manual change in your system (all\nreleases that consumed notes 3496530 / 3496562):\n\n 1. Start transaction SE80  \n 2. Open Class CL_EDO_MY_MM_APPL_CHECK  \n 3. Method GET_IV_TYPE, locate the following coding that was inserted by the\n    note (\u2248 line 45):\n\n      CASE lv_blart.\n        WHEN 'IV'.      \"Invoice\n          lv_iv_type = c_iv_type-inv.\n      ENDCASE.\n\n 4.

Transport the change into the quality and production systems.  \n\nAfter the correction a new eDocument is generated automatically for\n\n \u2022 an original Subsequent Credit (transaction MIRO, \u2018CR\u2019), and  \n \u2022 the cancellation credit memo created with MR8M.\n\npost-implementation steps\n-------------------------\n1. Re-execute report EDOC_MY_METADATA_CONV (or EDOC_ANALYZE_SNOTE) so that the\n   new IV-TYPE values are written to table EDOC_MY_SDOC.  \n2. Create the credit note again or, if you want to keep the already posted\n   FI document, run report EDOC_CREATE from SE38, select the FI document\n   number and choose \u201cGenerate Missing eDocument\u201d.\n\nwork-around (if coding change is not possible)\n----------------------------------------------\nImplement BAdI EDO_MY_MM_FILTER (filter for MM documents):\n\n   METHOD if_edo_my_mm_filter~is_mm_doc_relevant.\n     IF i_rbkpf-blart = 'CR'.      \"credit note\n       e_mm_doc_relevant = abap_true.\n     ENDIF.\n   ENDMETHOD.\n\nThis forces the cockpit to create the eDocument for credit notes until the\npermanent fix is imported.\n\nprerequisite check\n------------------\nPlease verify with Note Analyzer that the following prerequisite notes are\nalso in your system, otherwise import them before applying the above manual\nchange: 3498502, 3498514, 3499263, 3499266.\n\nWith the above correction you will be able to reproduce the scenario:\n\n \u2022 Cancel 5100000409/2024 in EDOC_COCKPIT \u2192 cancellation eDoc is generated  \n \u2022 MR8M cancellation FI document \u2192 eDoc is generated  \n \u2022 MIRO subsequent credit (\u2018copy details\u2019) \u2192 eDoc is generated and displayed\n   via Services for Object \u2192 Relationships.\n\nBest regards  \nSAP Product Support \u2013 CA-GTF-CSC-EDO-MY",

    "agent_judge_reasoning": "The generated answer provides a comprehensive and accurate explanation of the issue and its solution, which aligns well with the information obtained from the SAP documentation and troubleshooting tools. Here's why:\n\n1. Root cause identification: The answer correctly identifies that the system only writes Tourism-tax information when a \"real\" registration number is stored in the company-code master (OBY6, field STCD5). This aligns with the information from the sap_help_lookup tool, which confirms the importance of maintaining the Tourism Tax Registration Number in the master data.\n\n2. Solution provided: The answer offers a clear solution by recommending the implementation of specific SAP Notes (3413352 for S/4HANA and 3413351 for ECC 6.0 / EHP8). This demonstrates knowledge of the latest fixes for this issue.\n\n3. Configuration guidance: The answer provides detailed instructions on how to check and maintain the master data in OBY6, which is consistent with the information from the sap_help_lookup tool.\n\n4. XML structure explanation: The answer includes the correct XML structure for the Tourism Tax information, which addresses the user's concern about the missing node in the XML.\n\n5. Workaround option: The answer also provides a temporary workaround using a customer BAdI implementation, showing consideration for situations where immediate note implementation might not be possible.\n\n6. Alignment with expert answer: The generated answer expands on and provides more detailed information than the expert answer, while still aligning with its core message about the Tourism Tax node being mandatory and the option to implement a BADI if needed.\n\nOverall, the generated answer demonstrates a thorough understanding of the issue, provides accurate technical details, and offers both immediate and long-term solutions, making it fully helpful in addressing the user's question.",

    "generated_answer": "Root cause  \nWhen the e-Document is built after you post MIRO, the program looks for the \u201cReference number of customs form\u201d in the following sequence (standard SAP code \u2013 class CL_EDOC_MM_MAPPING, method GET_CUFORM_REF):  \n1. RBKP-IMPNR (field \u201cCustoms Form\u201d that can be entered directly in MIRO)  \n2. PO header text with Text ID = IMPORT_TEXT_TYPE  \n3. GR (MIGO) header text with the same text ID  \n\nAfter it has found the first non-initial value, SAP runs a syntactical check (method CHECK_CUFORM_REF).  \nAllowed pattern: A-Z, a-z, 0-9, maximum 35 characters, no blanks, no \u201c/ \u2013 _ , . ; : * # $ % &\u201d etc. Line breaks (CR/LF) are also regarded as \u201cspecial characters\u201d.  \nIf the string does not satisfy this pattern the system raises error  \nEDOCUMENT 281  \u201cSpecial characters are not allowed for reference number of customs form\u201d and the XML/PDF is not produced.  \n\nWhy it happens in your system  \n\u2022 You implemented your own logic that \u201cgrabs the value from the MIGO header text\u201d, but the framework actually stops one step earlier and picks up the PO header text (IMPORT_TEXT_TYPE).  \n\u2022 Although nothing obvious is maintained in the PO, the text object still contains an invisible line break or other non-printable character, so the check fails.  \n\nHow to solve / avoid the error  \n\nA. Maintain a correct value manually  \n  1. ME22N/ME23N \u2192 Header \u2192 Texts \u2192 Text ID IMPORT_TEXT_TYPE  \n  2. Enter a value that contains ONLY 0-9 or A-Z, no blanks, max. 35 char, e.g.  \n     2024FRIM12345678  \n  3. Save the PO, regenerate (or reset) the e-Document \u2192 OK.  \n\nB. Remove the wrong value  \n  Delete the text completely (no hidden CR/LF), save PO, recreate MIRO or run report EDOC_RESET to bring the document back to \u201cTo be generated\u201d and send again.  \n\nC. Clean the value automatically (recommended)  \n  1. Implement BAdI EDOC_ADJUST_DATA (Enhancement Spot EDOCUMENT_BADI).  \n  2. In method ADJUST_DATA read parameter C_HEADER-CUS_FORM_REF and strip all\n     non-alphanumerical characters, for example:  \n        REPLACE ALL OCCURRENCES OF REGEX '[^0-9A-Za-z]'  \n                      IN c_header-cus_form_ref WITH ''.  \n     or, if it becomes empty, clear the field so that it is simply not sent.  \n\nD. If you do not need to send the reference at all  \n  In the same BAdI simply clear C_HEADER-CUS_FORM_REF = ''.  \n\nE. Bring the standard up-to-date  \n  Apply the latest SAP Notes / Support Package for the relevant DRC solution.  \n  (e.g. SAP Note 3356410 for S/4HANA 2022 removes CR/LF automatically).  \n\nF. Adjust your own \u201cgrab\u201d logic  \n  If you still prefer to read the value from MIGO, move your code to the BAdI above and make sure it is executed after the standard mapping, or use a \u201cPOST\u201d filter in BAdI EDOC_MM_BADI.  \n\nChecklist for users / key-users  \n\u2610 Only alphanumeric characters, no spaces  \n\u2610 Max. 35 characters  \n\u2610 Maintain in MIRO directly or in PO header text ID IMPORT_TEXT_TYPE  \n\u2610 If not needed, keep field empty  \n\nOnce the value complies with the rules, the XML and PDF will be created and the document can be successfully submitted to DRC.",

    "generated_answer": "Reason for the failure  \nWhenever you send an e-document from the EDOC_COCKPIT the system calls the consumer proxy that was generated from the SAP Document-Compliance (or CPI) WSDL.  \nThe call is routed through the logical port that you have created in SOAMANAGER.  \nIf the data stored in that logical port (URL / user / certificate / OAuth profile) is no longer identical with what is expected in the cloud tenant, the cloud tenant answers with \u201c401 Unauthorized\u201d and the cockpit shows \u201cLogin failed\u201d.  \nThe SOAMANAGER \u201cPing Web Service\u201d test uses exactly the same logical port, therefore it fails as well.\n\nTypical root-causes  \n1. User or password in SOAMANAGER was changed or has expired in the cloud tenant.  \n2. Technical user in the cloud tenant is locked or does not have the role AuthGroup.BusinessCatalog\u2010EDOC_API_ACCESS.  \n3. The password was changed in the communication arrangement but not copied to SOAMANAGER.  \n4. New TLS/SSL certificate was installed on the CPI sub-account, but the corresponding root/intermediate CA is missing in the SSL client PSE of the on-premise system.  \n5. Wrong service URL after a tenant move (e.g. eu10 \u2192 eu30) or after switching from HTTP to HTTPS.  \n6. If you recently switched to OAuth 2.0: OAuth profile not maintained in SOAMANAGER or STRUST certificates missing.\n\nWhat to do \u2013 step by step  \n\nA. Check the exact error\n1. Start transaction SRT_UTIL \u2192 Error Log, repeat the cockpit send and look at the returned HTTP code.  \n   \u2022 401 = credentials issue  \n   \u2022 403 = authorisation or certificate issue  \n   \u2022 SSL handshake error in dev_icm = missing certificate  \n2. In SMICM (Goto \u2192 Trace \u2192 Display), set trace level to 2, reproduce the call once and read the log \u2013 you will immediately see whether the rejection comes after the TLS handshake or after user authentication.\n\nB. Correct the credentials\n1. Open SOAMANAGER \u2192 Web Service Configuration \u2192 search for the consumer proxy that is used (name usually contains EDOC* or refers to the country, e.g. CO_EDOC_MX_SEND).  \n2. Choose the active logical port \u2192 Edit.  \n   \u2022 Tab \u201cLogon Data\u201d: select \u201cUser ID / Password\u201d, enter the technical user created in the SAP BTP / CPI tenant, enter the current password (the one stored in the communication arrangement), confirm with Save.  \n   \u2022 If you are already on OAuth 2.0: instead of user/password select \u201cOAuth Profile\u201d, choose the profile you created via STRUST/SM59 (see SAP Note 2938865).  \n3. Press \u201cPing Web Service\u201d. Result must be green (HTTP 200). If green \u2192 cockpit will work as well.\n\nC. Repair authorisations in the cloud tenant (if 401 persists)  \n1. Log on to the CPI / SAP BTP subaccount \u2192 Security \u2192 Users. Make sure the communication user is not locked.  \n2. Assign or reassign the role collection that contains EDOC_API_ACCESS (name may vary by country).  \n3. If the password has just expired: set a new one, store the same value in SOAMANAGER.\n\nD. Renew or import SSL certificates (if you saw handshake errors)  \n1. Download the full certificate chain from the service URL in a browser (Root + Intermediate(s)).  \n2. In STRUST import the certificates into the SSL Client (ANON) or SSL Client (Standard) PSE and add them to the certificate list.  \n3. Press \u201cSave\u201d, then restart ICM (SMICM \u2192 Administration \u2192 ICM \u2192 Exit Soft).  \n4. Repeat \u201cPing Web Service\u201d.\n\nE. Verify repository settings  \n1. Check that the logical port still points to the correct host (host name, port 443, path /cxf/EDOC\u2026).  \n2. In SM59 double-check destination type G that might be referenced by the logical port (some templates use an HTTP destination instead of hard-coding the URL). Maintain the same user/password/OAuth profile here as well.\n\nF. Retest in EDOC_COCKPIT  \nReturn to EDOC_COCKPIT, pick one of the invoices with status \u201cError\u201d \u2192 Send. If everything is correct the status will change to \u201cIn Process/Sent\u201d.\n\nSummary of the key items to keep in sync  \n\u2022 URL of the service (tenant or data-centre changes)  \n\u2022 Valid TLS/SSL certificate chain in STRUST  \n\u2022 Technical communication user unlocked, correct roles in the cloud  \n\u2022 Same user/password or OAuth profile stored in the logical port (SOAMANAGER) and in any referenced SM59 destination  \n\nOnce the items above have been cross-checked and aligned, both SOAMANAGER\u2019s \u201cPing Web Service\u201d and the EDOC_COCKPIT send function will work again.",

It covers many of the key steps mentioned in the expert answer and aligns with the information provided by the sap_documentation_summary tool. \n\nHowever, there are some discrepancies and omissions when compared to the expert answer and the tool output:\n\n1. The generated answer provides more steps (10) than strictly necessary, some of which are not directly related to the customizing focus of the question.\n\n2. It doesn't explicitly mention the importance of inserting entries into the 'Mapping Class Determination for Interface ID' view in transaction EDOP, which is a crucial step highlighted in the expert answer.\n\n3. The answer doesn't provide the specific customizing entries for the mapping class determination as given in the expert answer (e.g., FR_INV_CREDIT_NOTE_REQUEST, FR_INV_INVOICE_REQUEST).\n\n4. While the generated answer covers many important aspects, it doesn't follow the exact structure and specificity of the expert answer, which might make it slightly less actionable for the user.\n\n5. The answer includes some steps that, while related to the overall process, aren't strictly part of the customizing focus requested in the question (e.g., testing steps).\n\nOverall, the generated answer is informative and covers many important points, but it's not as precisely aligned with the customizing focus and specific details provided in the expert answer. Therefore, it can be considered partially helpful.",

Method implementation: The generated code is more complex and extensive than the expert answer. While it covers more scenarios, it might be overwhelming for the specific question asked.\n\n4. Source type handling: The generated code correctly checks for the Settlement Management source type ('SM') before applying the specific logic, which is good practice.\n\n5.

Here's why:\n\n1. Completeness: The answer provides a complete implementation of the redefined FILL_PRICE_AMOUNT method, including the class definition and the method implementation.\n\n2. Accuracy: The generated code aligns well with the expert answer and the SAP documentation. It includes the necessary steps for calculating price amounts, handling different source types, and formatting the output.\n\n3. Enhancement for Settlement Management: The answer correctly identifies the need to add specific logic for the 'SM' (Settlement Management) source type, which was the core requirement of the question.\n\n4. Reuse of existing functionality: The generated code first calls the superclass implementation (super->fill_price_amount) to handle FI/SD documents, then adds the specific logic for Settlement Management documents.\n\n5. Detailed explanation: The answer includes comments and a detailed explanation of what the enhancement does, making it easy to understand the purpose and functionality of each part of the code.\n\n6. Alignment with SAP standards: The code uses SAP-specific data types (like edoc_price_amount) and follows SAP coding conventions.\n\n7. Comprehensive calculation: The code calculates all required fields for the French B2B-Invoice XSD, including netAmount, taxTotalAmount, taxExclusiveAmount, taxInclusiveAmount, payableAmount, and currencyCode.\n\nThe generated answer not only meets but exceeds the requirements specified in the question, providing a fully implemented solution with explanations.

    "agent_judge_reasoning": "The generated answer is partially helpful in addressing the question about enhancing the READ_CODES_FROM_HEADER_TEXT method for Settlement Management Documents in the France B2B eInvoice eDocument Process. Here's the reasoning:\n\n1. Positive aspects:\n   - The answer provides a complete implementation of a subclass (ZCL_EDOC_FR_B2B_PROC_SM) that inherits from CL_EDOC_FR_B2B_PROC and redefines the READ_CODES_FROM_HEADER_TEXT method.\n   - The implementation includes logic to handle Settlement Management documents (document category 'W5').\n   - The code reads the WB2_DOCUMENT header text and extracts codes enclosed in '#' symbols.\n   - The answer includes instructions on how to use the new class in the SAP system.\n\n2. Areas for improvement:\n   - The generated answer's implementation differs significantly from the expert answer. While both address the same problem, they use different approaches.\n   - The expert answer focuses on reading specific text IDs ('FRRC' for Routing Code and 'FRAD' for Addressing Line Code), while the generated answer reads a generic header text and extracts codes enclosed in '#' symbols.\n   - The generated answer doesn't explicitly handle the routing_code and addressing_line_code fields mentioned in the expert answer.\n\n3. Alignment with the question and context:\n   - The answer does address the need to redefine and enhance the READ_CODES_FROM_HEADER_TEXT method for Settlement Management Documents.\n   - However, it doesn't explicitly mention \"source type Settlement Management Documents\" or \"France B2B eInvoice eDocument Process\" as specified in the question.\n\n4. Consistency with SAP documentation:\n   - The generated answer is consistent with general SAP development practices (subclassing, method redefinition).\n   - However, the retrieved SAP documentation doesn't provide specific details about the READ_CODES_FROM_HEADER_TEXT method, making it difficult to verify the correctness of either the expert or generated answer.\n\nIn conclusion, while the generated answer provides a workable solution that addresses the core requirement of enhancing the READ_CODES_FROM_HEADER_TEXT method for Settlement Management documents, it differs significantly from the expert answer and lacks some specific details mentioned in the question. Therefore, it is classified as \"Partially Helpful\".",

Create ZCL_EDOC_FR_SETTLE_MAP\u2028  \n   INHERITING FROM  CL_EDOC_MAP_SETTLE_BASE.\n\n2.

Register the new class in Customizing view EDOC_C_MMAP  \n   Country = FR, Scenario = B2B, DocType = Settlement.\n\n4. Execute regression tests FR01-FR04.\n\nWith this inheritance\n\n\u2022 ~80 % of the code we copied disappears (\u22481 500 lines).  \n\u2022 All future generic corrections (e.g. SAP Notes on settlement logic) are inherited automatically.  \n\u2022 Only clearly delimited, France-specific code remains in ZCL_EDOC_FR_SETTLE_MAP.\n\nFallback\nIf CL_EDOC_MAP_SETTLE_BASE is not yet present in your release, the next best superclass would be CL_EDOC_MAP_ACCOUNTING_BASE, but this still forces you to duplicate the settlement-specific logic, so CL_EDOC_MAP_SETTLE_BASE is the recommended choice.",

The only standard mapper classes delivered are the ones that handle SD-billing, FI customer documents and MM (vendor) invoices.\n\nHow you can verify it in the system  \n\n1. Go to transaction SE16/SE16N and open table /EDO/CSOURCE (or view /EDO/V_CSOURCE in the IMG:  \u201ceDocument Framework \u2192 Define Source Types\u201d).  \n2. Put Scenario = \u2018FRB2B\u2019.  \n   You will find only these delivered records:\n\n   Source type            Mapping class delivered  \n   -----------------------------------------------------------  \n   SD_INV (SD billing)    CL_EDOC_FRB2B_MAP_SD  \n   FI_AR  (FI cust.)      CL_EDOC_FRB2B_MAP_FI  \n   MM_IV  (MM vendor)     CL_EDOC_FRB2B_MAP_MM  \n\n3. There is no record whose document origin = \u2018SM\u2019 (Settlement Management: tables CCKH/CCKML/ WBRK-WBRP).  \n4. A quick check in SE24 shows that the three classes above all implement interface IF_EDOC_MAP_BADI; none of them contains any logic for tables WB2_C_KONH, WBRK, WBRP etc., therefore they cannot be used for Settlement-Management documents without modification.\n\nWhat to do if you need Settlement-Management invoices in the FRB2B flow  \n\n\u2022 Copy one of the existing classes (usually CL_EDOC_FRB2B_MAP_SD, because it is already designed for sales-side invoices) into a Z-class.  \n\u2022 Enhance it so that it reads the Settlement-Management structures (WBRK/WBRP, CCKH, CCKML \u2026) and fills the same EDOC_HEADER / EDOC_ITEM structures that the SD mapper delivers.  \n\u2022 Register the new class as a new Source Type (e.g. \u2018SM_INV\u2019) for scenario FRB2B in the IMG node \u201cDefine Source Types\u201d.  \n\u2022 Activate it and test end-to-end (creation in EDOC_COCKPIT, XML generation, signature, etc.).\n\nSo, there is indeed \u201calready a class mapping another source type\u201d (three of them in fact), but none of those is intended for Settlement-Management documents.",

Make sure the DRC framework itself is working  \n   \u2022 All relevant SAP Notes / Support Packages for DRC are in the system.  \n   \u2022 The business function or cloud scope item that delivers DRC is activated (for on-premise: FIN_LOC_DRC; for Cloud: scope item 1J2/1J3).  \n   \u2022 The generic/customizing delivered by SAP for DRC (number ranges, authority-texts, user roles, etc.) has been carried out and at least one SAP-delivered process can be executed end-to-end.  \n\n2. Register a dedicated software component for your customer objects  \n   Customizing path: Document and Reporting Compliance \u2192 Extensibility \u2192 Define Software Component for Extensibility.  \n   This step creates/assigns the Z- or Y-package in which every object (CDS view, class, form template, etc.) that belongs to the new process will later be saved.\n\n3.

Gather and structure the business requirements / source data  \n   \u2022 List every field that must be reported and where it resides in the S/4HANA data model.  \n   \u2022 Decide whether you can reuse standard CDS views or need new ones.  \n   \u2022 Collect or build the physical output artefact that the authority expects (XSD, Excel/CSV layout, form template, etc.).  \n\nOnce these four items are in place you have fulfilled SAP\u2019s prerequisites and can start with the actual extensibility work: building the CDS view hierarchy, implementing the data-provider BAdI/class, registering the data provider against the process, testing, and finally releasing the new process to business users.",

What an action is  \n   \u2022 In Customizing (IMG \u2192 Cross-Application Components \u2192 Document Compliance\n     \u2192 eDocument Cockpit \u2192 Define Actions) every action is represented by an\n     entry that points to an ABAP class, the validator class, icons, texts\n     etc.  \n   \u2022 The implementation class must implement interface IF_EDOC_ACTION\n     (optionally IF_EDOC_ACTION_VALIDATOR).\n\n2. What SAP allows in a Private Cloud tenant  \n   \u2022 All SAP-delivered action classes (for example\n     CL_EDOC_ACTION_SUBMIT, CL_EDOC_ACTION_CANCEL) are not released for\n     modification.  \n   \u2022 Making an implicit/explicit enhancement or a modification to those\n     classes is not permitted in Private Cloud (and would break the \u201cno\n     modification\u201d rule).  \n   \u2022 However, Private Cloud still gives you full developer extensibility in\n     the Z/Y namespaces. You can therefore build your own class that copies\n     or re-implements the logic you need.\n\n3. What you have to do  \n   a. Create a Z-class that implements IF_EDOC_ACTION (copy SAP logic if\n      required).  \n   b. (Optional) Create a Z-class that implements\n      IF_EDOC_ACTION_VALIDATOR if you need cockpit-time checks.  \n   c. In the IMG activity \u201cDefine Actions\u201d create a new action code in your\n      customer namespace and assign the classes created in a) / b).  \n   d. In the IMG activity \u201cAssign Actions to Processes\u201d (or the Fiori app\n      \u201cMaintain eDocument Process Types\u201d) assign the new action to the\n      custom process you built.  \n   e. Transport the settings.\n\n4. What you cannot do  \n   \u2022 Add methods, redefine methods or use enhancements inside SAP standard\n     action classes.  \n   \u2022 Replace the SAP class in an SAP-delivered action entry (this would be a\n     modification).  \n   \u2022 Use the SAP action code directly for a new process and expect a\n     different behaviour without creating your own implementation.\n\nTherefore: For a custom process in S/4HANA Private Cloud you must create a\nnew (customer-namespace) action instead of extending an existing SAP\naction, and then assign that new action to your process.",

    "answer": "Based on the provided information, it appears that the wrong logical port and URL path have been determined for the CO_DCS_DCP_GENERIC_WEBSERVICE in the SOA Manager configuration. The incorrect URL path that has been determined is '/cxf/PeppolLookup', which is causing the error when trying to display HTML. We assume this comes from the currently registered logical port in EDOSOASERV.\nTo resolve this issue, the correct logical port and URL path need to be determined and updated in the SOA Manager configuration. The correct logical port to be maintained is 'EDO_DCS_DCP_GENERC_WEBSERVICE'.\nPlease follow these steps:\n1. Access SAP and navigate to 'SM30 -> EDOSOASERV (Defining SOA Services for Communication)'.\n2. Search for 'EU_GENERIC_WEBSERV' and specify 'EDO_DCS_DCP_GENERC_WEBSERVICE'.\n3. Check the URL path for the logical port 'CO_DCS_DCP_GENERIC_WEBSERVICE' / 'EDO_DCS_DCP_GENERC_WEBSERVICE' in the SOA Manager configuration with the correct URL path from https: //help.sap.com/docs/cloud-edition/sap-document-and-reporting-compliance-cloud-edition/creating-logical-ports-in-soa-management-sap-s-4hana-network-exchange\nOnce the correct logical port and URL path have been determined and updated, the issue with generating HTML should be resolved.",

However, it has some limitations when compared to the expert answer and the specific question asked:\n\n1. Relevance: The generated answer covers general configuration issues related to CO_DCS_DCP_GENERIC_WEBSERVICE and HTML preview, which is relevant to the question. However, it doesn't directly address the specific error mentioned in the question about the wrong logical port and URL path.\n\n2. Accuracy: The information provided in the generated answer is generally accurate and aligns with the SAP documentation. It covers important aspects such as logical port configuration, OAuth 2.0 credentials, and root certificate management.\n\n3. Completeness: The generated answer is more comprehensive than the expert answer in some ways, providing a broader range of troubleshooting steps. However, it misses the specific point about the incorrect URL path '/cxf/PeppolLookup' mentioned in the question and expert answer.\n\n4. Specificity: The expert answer is more specific to the issue at hand, mentioning the exact logical port 'EDO_DCS_DCP_GENERC_WEBSERVICE' that should be maintained. The generated answer doesn't provide this level of specificity.\n\n5. Action items: Both answers provide actionable steps, but the expert answer is more focused on the specific issue mentioned in the question.\n\n6. Additional information: The generated answer provides some useful additional information, such as typical symptoms and their causes, as well as relevant SAP Notes, which could be helpful for troubleshooting.\n\nIn conclusion, while the generated answer provides valuable general information about configuring and troubleshooting CO_DCS_DCP_GENERIC_WEBSERVICE, it doesn't fully address the specific issue mentioned in the question. It's partially helpful but lacks the precise focus and targeted solution provided in the expert answer.",
