    "generated_answer": ".\nFinal Answer\n\nKey Findings (Based on SAP Documentation and Help Outputs):\n\n1. **Primary Mechanism: Business Add-Ins (BAdIs) and Custom Logic App**\n   - The standard way to extend eDocument Actions for custom-developed processes in SAP S/4HANA Private Cloud is by implementing BAdIs (Business Add-Ins).\n   - The Custom Logic app (SAP Fiori) is used to implement these BAdIs, allowing you to inject custom ABAP logic into the eDocument process.\n\n2. **Typical Extension Scenarios**\n   - **Add Custom Fields:** You can add custom fields to the eDocument Cockpit UI and data model, enabling additional data capture or display.\n   - **Custom Processing Logic:** Implement logic to determine when eDocuments should be created, modify or validate the final XML, or enrich data before submission.\n   - **Enhanced Authorization:** Use custom fields and logic to restrict visibility or actions in the Cockpit based on organizational or business rules.\n   - **Custom Actions:** Extend the process to trigger additional actions, such as sending emails to customers or embedding extra documents in the XML.\n\n3. **Step-by-Step Procedure**\n   - **Step 1:** Open the Custom Logic app in SAP Fiori.\n   - **Step 2:** Select the business context (usually \"Document Compliance\").\n   - **Step 3:** Choose and implement the relevant BAdI, such as:\n     - `EDOC_ADAPTOR_CLOUD` (for general eDocument processing enhancements)\n     - BAdIs for custom fields, UI extensions, or XML modification\n   - **Step 4:** Write and activate your custom ABAP logic.\n   - **Step 5:** Test the extension in the eDocument Cockpit (`EDOC_COCKPIT`) or Manage Electronic Documents app.\n\n4. **Technical Example**\n   - To add a custom field to the XML:\n     - Implement the BAdI for XML modification.\n     - In your ABAP code, add logic to populate the new field and insert it into the XML structure before submission.\n   - To control document creation:\n     - Implement the BAdI that checks if an eDocument should be created for a given source document, and add your business rules.\n\n5. **Plain-Language Summary**\n   - In SAP Private Cloud, you can tailor the eDocument process to your business needs by using built-in extension points (BAdIs). These let you add new fields, change how documents are processed, or trigger extra actions\u2014without modifying SAP standard code. All of this is done through user-friendly Fiori apps designed for key users and developers.\n\n6. **Limitations/Uncertainties**\n   - The specific BAdIs available may vary depending on your SAP S/4HANA version and country localization.\n   - Some advanced scenarios (e.g., deep integration with external systems) may require additional configuration or development.",

This can be due to a misconfigured authentication method, invalid credentials, or missing authorizations.\n- For S/4HANA Cloud, ClientCertificateAuthentication is required, not BasicAuthentication.\n- The technical user must have all required roles and authorizations in both the SAP backend and Peppol Exchange.\n- Configuration mismatches (hostnames, LocationID) or missing participant registration can also cause this error.\n\nPlain-Language Summary:\n- Your document is stuck because the system trying to send or receive it cannot log in or is not allowed to perform the action. This is usually due to a password, certificate, or permission problem, or a mismatch in system settings.\n\nExample Checklist for Troubleshooting:\n1. Check the authentication method in your SAP BTP destination (use certificate authentication if required).\n2. Verify the user and password are correct and not locked.\n3. Ensure the technical user has all required roles and authorizations.\n4. Confirm that hostnames and LocationID match between Cloud Connector and Peppol Exchange dashboard.\n5. Make sure both sender and receiver participant IDs are registered in Peppol.\n6. Review and implement relevant SAP Notes (e.g., 3498170, 2926868, 2949379).\n\nRemaining Uncertainties or Limitations:\n- The exact root cause in your environment will depend on your specific configuration. If the above checks do not resolve the issue, further investigation of system logs and SAP Notes referenced in the tool outputs is recommended.",

If SAP releases new features or updates, this scenario may change in the future.",

    "generated_answer": "Key Findings:\n- For Peppol Exchange integration with SAP S/4HANA Cloud, you must upload a client certificate for the communication user. This certificate is used for SSL client certificate authentication, as Basic Auth is not supported.\n- The certificate must be the public key of the client system that will connect to S/4HANA Cloud (e.g., your Peppol Exchange or middleware system).\n- Supported formats for upload are: `.pem`, `.crt`, or `.cert`.\n\nHow to Obtain the Certificate:\n- The certificate is not generated by SAP S/4HANA Cloud. It must be generated by the system that will act as the client (the system initiating the connection to S/4HANA Cloud).\n- Typically, your Peppol Exchange provider or your middleware team will generate a key pair (private and public key). The public key certificate (in .pem, .crt, or .cert format) is then provided to you for upload.\n- If you are operating your own middleware, you can generate a certificate using tools like OpenSSL, ensuring it is in one of the supported formats.\n\nHow to Upload:\n1. Go to the \"Maintain Communication Users\" (Fiori app F1338) in S/4HANA Cloud.\n2. Create or select the communication user.\n3. In the certificate section, upload the public client certificate file.\n4. Save the user.\n5. In the \"Communication Systems\" app, assign this user and set the authentication method to \"SSL Client Certificate\".\n\nExample:\n- If your middleware team provides you with a file named `client-cert.pem`, you upload this file to the communication user in S/4HANA Cloud.\n\nPlain-language summary:\n- You need a digital certificate file (public key) from the system that will connect to SAP S/4HANA Cloud. This is not something SAP provides; you get it from your Peppol Exchange provider or your own IT/middleware team. Upload this file (in .pem, .crt, or .cert format) to the communication user in SAP S/4HANA Cloud.\n\nLimitations:\n- If you do not control the connecting system, you must request the certificate from your Peppol Exchange provider or integration partner.\n- If you are unsure how to generate a certificate, your IT security or middleware team should assist.",

Implement the BAdIs:\n   - EDOC_CUSTOM_FIELDS_CLOUD (for backend logic, e.g., populating the field from source documents)\n   - EDOC_CUSTOM_FIELDS_UI_CLOUD (for UI-specific logic)\n   You can use filter conditions to target specific processes (e.g., billing or accounting).\n3. Once published and implemented, your custom field will be available in the eDocument Cockpit and can be used for display, filtering, reporting, and authorization logic.\n\nExample:\n- To add a \"Total Weight\" field:\n  - Define it in the Custom Fields app as a \"Quantity with Unit.\"\n  - Implement logic in the Custom Logic app to populate it from the relevant source document.\n  - The field will then appear in the eDocument Cockpit and can be used for filtering or restricting document visibility.\n\nPlain-language summary:\nYou can add your own fields to these apps in SAP S/4HANA Public Cloud using standard SAP extensibility tools, without modifying standard code.

    "generated_answer": ".\nFinal Answer:\n\nKey Findings:\n- In SAP S/4HANA Cloud Private Edition (Private Cloud), you can create and use custom fields within Document and Reporting Compliance (DRC), including the Manage Electronic Documents app (Fiori App ID: F4306).\n- Custom fields are created using the Custom Fields app, assigned to relevant business contexts, and published so they are available in the DRC data model and APIs.\n- You can extend DRC processes (such as e-invoicing or statutory reporting) to include these custom fields, and they can be made available in APIs and output mappings (e.g., for UBL or Peppol formats).\n- Visibility and behavior of custom fields (such as making them mandatory, read-only, or conditionally visible) can be controlled via the User Interfaces tab in the Custom Fields app. This is supported in Private Cloud, similar to Public Cloud, though some app-specific limitations may apply.\n\nTechnical Explanation:\n- After creating a custom field, you can configure its visibility and behavior in the User Interfaces tab. For example, you can set a field to be visible only under certain conditions using ABAP logic or configuration.\n- To ensure the custom field is available for DRC processes, you must publish it and, if needed, enable it for relevant APIs or OData services.\n- If you want the custom field to influence document visibility (e.g., filter which documents are shown based on the field), you may need to implement additional logic or use extensibility options such as BAdIs or custom CDS views.\n\nExample:\nSuppose you add a custom field \"Document Category\" to electronic documents. You can configure the field to be visible only for certain document types, and you can use it as a filter in the Manage Electronic Documents app or in reporting APIs.\n\nPlain-Language Summary:\nYes, in SAP S/4HANA Private Cloud, you can use DRC extensibility to add custom fields to electronic documents and control their visibility. This is done through the Custom Fields app, where you can set when and how these fields appear. You can also use these fields to filter or manage document visibility in the DRC apps, provided you configure the necessary logic.\n\nLimitations:\n- Some advanced visibility controls may require custom ABAP logic or BAdI implementations.\n- Not all DRC apps may support every extensibility feature; check app-specific documentation if you encounter limitations.",

However, you can achieve the same result by using the \"Custom Business Objects\" (CBO) framework, which is the officially supported method for creating custom tables in the Public Cloud.\n\n**Technical Explanation:**\n- Use the Fiori app \"Custom Business Objects\" to define and publish a new business object, which acts as a custom table.\n- You can add fields, set properties, and expose the CBO via OData for integration with DRC processes or custom logic (e.g., via BAdIs).\n- CBOs are upgrade-safe, managed through the cloud extensibility framework, and can be used for storing DRC-specific data, mappings, or logs.\n\n**Plain-Language Summary:**\nYou cannot create custom tables the old way in SAP Public Cloud, but you can use a special tool (Custom Business Objects) to create your own tables for DRC or other purposes. This is the recommended and supported approach for new country process implementations.\n\n**Example:**\nTo create a custom table for a new DRC country process:\n1. Open the \"Custom Business Objects\" Fiori app.\n2. Define your business object (e.g., \"ZDRC_COUNTRY_MAPPING\").\n3. Add the fields you need (e.g., Country Code, Tax Authority Code, Internal Mapping).\n4.

    "generated_answer": ".\n**Final Answer:**\n\n**Key Findings:**\n- In SAP S/4HANA Public Cloud, the BAdI `EDOC_CLOUD_ADAPTOR` method `SET_OUTPUT_DATA` supports the following standard source types for extensibility:\n  - **SD-Billing Documents** (Sales and Distribution billing)\n  - **FI-Accounting Documents** (Financial Accounting)\n  - **Convergent Invoicing Documents** (source type: `CI_DOCUM`)\n- The actual list of supported source types may vary by country/region and legal requirement. For example, Finland supports `CI_DOCUM` for the EU eInvoice process.\n\n**How This Is Supported:**\n- **SAP Documentation** confirms that these source types are standard and that the method is designed to process them for electronic document creation.\n- **SAP Help** details the extensibility mechanism: to enable or extend a source type, you create extension classes (e.g., `ZCL_EDOC_EXT_CI_DOCUM`) implementing interfaces like `IF_EDOC_SOURCE_EXTENSION` and `IF_EDOC_SOURCE_PROCESS_EXT`. These classes determine relevance, process mapping, and data mapping for the eDocument output.\n\n**Technical Explanation:**\n- The `SET_OUTPUT_DATA` method is called during eDocument processing to map source document data (from SD, FI, or CI) to the output structure (such as UBL or Peppol XML).\n- Extensibility is achieved by implementing and registering custom extension classes for your source type. These classes allow you to define how data from your source document is mapped to the output format.\n\n**Plain-Language Summary:**\n- If you want to extend or customize how electronic documents are generated in SAP Public Cloud, you can do so for standard document types like invoices and accounting documents. SAP provides a way to plug in your own logic for these document types using special extension classes.\n\n**Example:**\n- To enable Convergent Invoicing (`CI_DOCUM`) for eInvoicing in Finland, you would:\n  1. Create a class `ZCL_EDOC_EXT_CI_DOCUM` implementing `IF_EDOC_SOURCE_EXTENSION`.\n  2. Optionally, create a process extension class for specific processes (e.g., `ZCL_EDOC_EXT_CI_DOCUM_FIINV`).\n  3. Register these classes in the system configuration.\n  4. Your logic will then be called by `SET_OUTPUT_DATA` during eDocument processing.\n\n**Limitations/Uncertainties:**\n- The exact list of supported source types may change with SAP releases or by country localization. Always check the latest SAP documentation or configuration for your specific scenario.\n\n**Task complete.**",

You can then submit it, and the system processes the XML through mapping and integration steps before sending it to the tax authority.\n\n**Technical Explanation:**\n- The extensibility is achieved via BAdIs, which are enhancement points provided by SAP for customers to insert their own logic without modifying standard code.\n- In the Public Cloud, you use the \"Custom Logic\" app to implement these BAdIs. For Greek eInvoicing, you typically enhance the XML for invoices or credit notes.\n- Example: You might implement a BAdI to add a custom field to the XML, or to adjust a value based on business rules.\n\n**Plain-Language Summary:**\n- If you need to change or add information to the XML files sent to the Greek tax authority, SAP provides a way to do this without changing the standard system. You use a special tool (the Custom Logic app) to add your own rules or data to the XML files before they are sent.\n\n**Example:**\n- Suppose you need to add a custom tax code to the XML. You would:\n  1. Open the Custom Logic app.\n  2. Select the relevant BAdI for eDocument XML enhancement.\n  3. Write your logic to add or modify the XML field.\n  4. Save and activate your enhancement.\n  5. The next time an eDocument is generated, your logic will be applied.\n\n**Limitations/Uncertainties:**\n- The answer is based on official SAP documentation for Public Cloud and Greece. No contradictory information was found in troubleshooting sources.\n- If you require more advanced or country-specific enhancements, always check for the latest SAP documentation or consult SAP support.\n\n**Task complete.**",

    "generated_answer": "To restrict the creation of eDocuments in the Manage Electronic Document App or the eDocument Cockpit app for Spain in SAP S/4HANA Public Cloud, follow these implementation steps:\n\n**1. Restrict via Selection Parameters (Standard Approach):**\n   - When scheduling the \"Create eDocuments\" job, limit the selection criteria (company code, posting/entry date, document type).\n   - Only documents matching these criteria will be processed for eDocument creation.\n   - This is the default and simplest way to restrict which documents are converted into eDocuments.\n\n**2. Restrict via Authorization and Business Catalogs:**\n   - Assign business roles and catalogs (e.g., `SAP_FI_BC_GLO_EDOC_ES_PC`, `SAP_BR_GL_ACCOUNTANT_ES`) to control which users can access the apps and perform eDocument creation.\n   - This restricts *who* can create eDocuments, not *which* documents are processed.\n\n**3. Advanced Restriction via Custom Logic (BAdI Implementation):**\n   - Use the Custom Logic app to implement BAdIs such as `ES_DOCUMENT_CLOUD` and `EDOC_ADAPTOR_CLOUD`.\n   - In your BAdI implementation, add logic to check your business criteria (e.g., block creation for certain document types, values, or organizational units).\n   - If the criteria are not met, prevent the creation of the eDocument.\n   - Example (pseudo-code for BAdI logic):\n     ```abap\n     IF <your_condition_to_block_creation>.\n       RAISE EXCEPTION TYPE /edocument/creation_blocked.\n     ENDIF.\n     ```\n   - This approach allows granular, programmatic control over eDocument creation.\n\n**4. Restrict Visibility via Custom Fields and Enhanced Authorization:**\n   - Extend the eDocument Cockpit with custom fields (e.g., organizational unit).\n   - Populate these fields from the source document.\n   - Use enhanced authorization checks to restrict visibility of eDocuments based on these fields.\n   - Note: This restricts *access* to eDocuments, not their creation.\n\n**Plain-language summary:**  \nYou can restrict eDocument creation in Spain\u2019s Public Cloud by carefully setting up job selection criteria, controlling user roles, or\u2014if you need more granular control\u2014implementing custom logic (BAdIs) to block creation based on your business rules. For visibility restrictions, use custom fields and enhanced authorizations.\n\n**Example scenario:**  \nIf you want to block eDocument creation for zero-value invoices, implement a BAdI in `EDOC_ADAPTOR_CLOUD` that checks the invoice amount and prevents creation if the amount is zero.\n\n**Limitations:**  \n- Standard configuration does not provide a direct \"block\" option for specific documents; custom logic is required for advanced scenarios.\n- Visibility restrictions do not prevent creation, only access.",

It is implemented using the Custom Logic app and is the main extensibility point for backend logic.\n  2. **EDOC_CUSTOM_FIELDS_UI_CLOUD**: This BAdI lets you control the visibility, column description, and tooltip of custom fields in the app\u2019s UI.\n\nHow the tools supported the answer:\n- The SAP documentation summary provided a step-by-step process and named the relevant BAdIs.\n- The SAP Help lookup confirmed these BAdIs and provided additional technical context, including their enhancement spots and implementation details.\n\nTechnical Explanation:\n- **EDOC_CUSTOM_FIELDS_CLOUD**: Implement this BAdI to fill custom fields in the eDocument XML based on your business logic. For example, you can map a custom field like \"Total Weight\" from the source document into the eDocument.\n- **EDOC_CUSTOM_FIELDS_UI_CLOUD**: Use this BAdI to define how your custom fields appear in the Manage Electronic Documents app, such as setting their visibility or tooltips.\n\nExample (simplified ABAP pseudocode for EDOC_CUSTOM_FIELDS_CLOUD implementation):\n```abap\nMETHOD if_edoc_custom_fields_cloud~fill_custom_fields.\n  LOOP AT it_source_data INTO DATA(ls_source).\n    IF ls_source-fieldname = 'TOTAL_WEIGHT'.\n      es_custom_fields-total_weight = ls_source-value.\n    ENDIF.\n  ENDLOOP.\nENDMETHOD.\n```\n\nPlain-language summary:\n- You can add custom fields to the Manage Electronic Documents app in SAP S/4HANA Public Cloud by creating the fields in the Custom Fields app and then using the BAdIs EDOC_CUSTOM_FIELDS_CLOUD (for backend logic) and EDOC_CUSTOM_FIELDS_UI_CLOUD (for UI control) to integrate and display them.\n\nLimitations:\n- Only BAdIs officially released for Public Cloud are supported.\n- Implementation is done via the Custom Logic app; direct ABAP modifications are not possible in Public Cloud.",
