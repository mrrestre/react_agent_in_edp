    "answer": "To attach additional files to the standard XML in Public Cloud, you can use the Business Add-In (BAdI) EDOC_ADAPTOR_CLOUD and enhance the XML file generated for an electronic document.\nBy enhancing the XML file, you can include additional information that may be relevant for your business processes .\nTo implement this enhancement, you can follow these steps in ABAP Development Tools (ADT):\n1. In your ABAP project, go to the enhancement spot ES_EDOCUMENT_CLOUD and select 'New BAdI Enhancement Implementation'.\n2. Enter a package, name, and description for the implementation.\n3. Choose 'Add BAdI Implementation' and select EDOC_ADAPTOR_CLOUD .\n4. (Optional) Create a BAdI filter for Country and/or Generic Filter.\n5. Choose 'Implementing Class' to create a new implementation class.\n6. Activate your BAdI implementation .\nOnce you have implemented the BAdI, you can fill the XML tag <BuyersItemIdentification> with the desired additional information.\nThis can be done by reading the relevant data from the source documents and filling the appropriate XML tags.\nPlease note that the specific implementation details may vary depending on your system setup and requirements.\nIt is recommended to refer to the provided sources for more detailed instructions and examples.",

    "generated_answer": "Technical explanation  \nThe eDocument framework that is shipped with SAP S/4HANA Cloud (Public Cloud) already contains a utility class that creates and stores \u201cextra\u201d files next to the standard XML.  \nThe search result you see below is the productive coding used by SAP:\n\n\u2022 Class CL_EDOC_CO_SEND_CUST_ATTACH \u2013 method _prepare_edocument_file  \n```\nls_edocumentfile-file_raw = lv_xml.               \"your payload (xstring)\n...\nls_edocumentfile-file_type = c_attached.          \" = \u2018ATTACHED\u2019\nls_edocumentfile-edoc_guid = g_edoc_guid.\nls_edocumentfile-file_guid = cl_edoc_util=>create_uuid( ).\n```\n\nAny file that is handed over with FILE_TYPE = ATTACHED is written into table EDOCUMENTFILE and automatically\n  \u2022 gets a unique FILE_GUID  \n  \u2022 is linked to the eDocument header (EDOC_GUID)  \n  \u2022 is picked up by the standard send routine; the PEPPOL/AS-4 envelope is sent as a\n    multi-part MIME message and an <AdditionalDocumentReference> node is inserted\n    into the UBL XML that points to the attachment.\n\nHow to use this in the Public-Cloud edition\n\n1. Activate the released BAdI EDOC_CO_ATTACH_CUSTOM_DOC (business context: Electronic Document \u2013 Outbound).  \n   In the implementation you receive the eDocument GUID and you simply return the\n   file content (xstring) and its MIME type.  \n   The framework calls the coding above, so nothing else must be written.\n\n2. Optional\u2014or if you do not want to code\u2014use the public OData service  \n   SAP_COM_0638 \u201cElectronic Document File Attachment\u201d:  \n   \u2022 POST /ElectronicDocumentFileSet  \n   \u2022 Key fields: EdocGuid, FileType = \u2018ATTACHED\u2019, FileName, FileRaw (base64).  \n   The service persists the record in EDOCUMENTFILE; the next \u201cSubmit Electronic\n   Document\u201d run will send it.\n\n3. Maintain which attachment types are allowed via SSCUI 102891\n   \u201cDefine Attachment Types for Electronic Documents\u201d (e.g. PDF, TXT).\n\n4. Run the normal transmission (\u201cSubmit\u201d, background job or API).  \n   You will see the extra file in app \u201cManage Electronic Documents\u201d; for PEPPOL the\n   receiver gets the XML plus a second MIME part; for other country solutions the\n   attachment is delivered if the local web service allows it.\n\nImportant limitations in Public Cloud  \n\u2022 You cannot physically embed a binary object inside the XML; the framework always sends it as a separate MIME part and references it via AdditionalDocumentReference.  \n\u2022 Only file types that you configured in SSCUI 102891 or allowed by the tax authority / PEPPOL BIS profile will be accepted.  \n\u2022 All logic has to be implemented in the released BAdI or by using the OData service; classic implicit enhancements are not possible.\n\nShort example (BAdI skeleton)  \n```abap\nMETHOD if_edoc_co_attach_custom_doc~get_custom_attachment.\n  \"iv_edoc_guid \u2013 GUID of eDocument\n  DATA lv_pdf TYPE xstring.\n  lv_pdf = zcl_my_pdf_generator=>create_pdf_for_invoice( iv_edoc_guid ).\n\n  es_file_content-file_raw  = lv_pdf.\n  es_file_content-file_name = |Invoice_{ iv_edoc_guid }.pdf|.\n  es_file_content-file_type = 'ATTACHED'.          \"must match SSCUI 102891\nENDMETHOD.\n```\n\nPlain-language summary  \nIn S/4HANA Cloud you do not change the standard XML; instead you instruct the eDocument framework\u2014through a released BAdI or the dedicated File-Attachment OData API\u2014to store a separate file record (type ATTACHED). At send time the framework automatically transmits that file alongside the XML and inserts the proper reference element, so the recipient obtains both documents.",

    "generated_answer": "Technical explanation  \n1. How eDocument Cockpit actions are wired  \n   \u2022 Every button in the cockpit corresponds to an \u201caction code\u201d stored in table/view EDOACTION (UI-type or Process-type).  \n   \u2022 When the user presses the button, CL_EDOC_DCC_ACTION \u2192 execute_dcc( ) is called.  \n     \u2013 For a UI action it looks up view EDOACTWEBUIMETHV and dynamically calls the class / method you maintained there.  \n     \u2013 For a Process action it forwards the call to the process-manager object (lo_edocument\u2192mo_process->execute_action).  \n   \u2022 SAP-delivered actions are client-independent (content marked as SAP in EDOACTION) and the framework checks the action name hard-coded constants such as gc_action-submit, gc_action-cancel, \u2026 (see CL_EDOC_ACTION, CL_EDOC_DCC_ACTION).  \n\n2. What is allowed in S/4HANA Private Cloud  \n   \u2022 You do NOT have modification rights on SAP rows in EDOACTION / EDOACTWEBUIMETHV, so you cannot \u201cextend\u201d an SAP action.  \n   \u2022 You CAN create your own actions (key must start with Y* or Z*).  \n     Steps:  \n       1. IMG \u2192 Document Compliance \u2192 Electronic Documents \u2192 Define Action \u2192 create new entry (e.g. ZSEND_TO_PARTNER) \u2013 mark it as \u201cProcess\u201d or \u201cUI\u201d.  \n       2. IMG \u2192 \u2026 \u2192 Assign Action to Process (view EDODCCPROCACTNV) \u2013 assign it to your custom process ZPROC01 and the relevant process-step variant.  \n       3. (If UI action) maintain view EDOACTWEBUIMETHV and point it to your own ABAP class/method (e.g. ZCL_MY_DCC_UI \u2192 send_to_partner).  \n       4. (If Process action) in your process class (ZCL_EDOC_PROCESS_\u2026) or, for released Steampunk extension, in the partner class called from CL_EDOCUMENT_EXT, implement the logic for that action in method execute_action( ).  \n\n3. Result  \n   \u2022 The cockpit automatically shows the new button; when pressed it calls your code.  \n   \u2022 Trying to \u201chook into\u201d or overwrite a delivered action is not supported and will be rejected by the framework (constants check, protected customizing).  \n\nPlain-language summary  \nIn a Private-Cloud system you cannot change or extend a standard cockpit action, but you can add your own new actions for a custom eDocument process: create a Y/Z action in customizing, map it to your process, and implement the corresponding ABAP class/method.",

No transports or keys are needed in the public-cloud system.  \n\nResult  \n\u2022 When the defined condition is met the Create button still appears, but pressing it (or running the mass job) ends immediately with status \u201cNot relevant\u201d; no entry is generated in AIF nor sent to Peppol.  \n\u2022 If the condition is not met, creation proceeds as usual.  \n\nLimitations  \n\u2022 You cannot \u201chide\u201d the Create button; you can only reject creation.  \n\u2022 Once an eDocument exists the BAdI is no longer called; you would have to cancel it manually.  \n\nOne-sentence summary  \nYes\u2014by implementing the cloud BAdI MODIFY_IS_RELEVANT in the Custom Logic app you can programmatically return cx_relevant = abap_false and thereby stop users (or jobs) from creating German eDocuments whenever your own conditions are true.",

In your S/4HANA Cloud tenant open \u201cCustom Logic\u201d (app F1481).  \n2. Create a new enhancement implementation:  \n   \u2022 Business Context\u2003\u2003Electronic Document  \n   \u2022 BAdI Name\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003 EDOC_PART_CONN_CHANGE_EMAIL_V2  \n   \u2022 Filter Country\u2003\u2003\u2003DE  \n3. In the generated ABAP class copy only the lines you need from SAP\u2019s sample (see code snippet below) and add your own logic \u2013 e.g. change the subject or append a marketing PDF.  \n4. Activate and transport. No configuration, no whitelisting of APIs is required.\n\nExample snippet (minimal)\n```\nMETHOD if_edc_part_conn_change_email_v2~change_email.\n\n  \"add a custom subject line\n  CONCATENATE 'Rechnung ' edocument-source_key\n              format( edocument-create_date AS DATE ) INTO emailsubject\n              SEPARATED BY space.\n\n  \"prepend greeting text\n  emailcontenttext = VALUE #( BASE emailcontenttext\n                              ( |Sehr geehrte Damen und Herren,| )\n                              ( |anbei Ihre elektronische Rechnung.| )\n                              ( '' ) ).               \"blank line\n\n  \"add additional recipient\n  APPEND 'cc-team@mycompany.de' TO emailrecipientscc.\n\n  \"attach a company brochure (already stored as MIME object)\n  DATA pdf_xstr TYPE xstring.\n  pdf_xstr = cl_mime_repository_api=>get( '/SAP/BC/BROCHURE.PDF' ).\n  APPEND VALUE edoc_email_attachment(\n         attachm_subject = 'Broschuere'\n         attachm_type    = 'PDF'\n         content_hex     = cl_document_bcs=>xstring_to_solix( pdf_xstr )\n         attachm_size    = xstrlen( pdf_xstr ) ) TO attachments.\n\nENDMETHOD.\n```\n\nResult\nEvery customer invoice e-mail sent for German companies now carries the modified subject, body, extra CC recipient and new attachment.\n\nPlain-language takeaway\nUse Cloud BAdI EDOC_PART_CONN_CHANGE_EMAIL_V2 (via the \u201cCustom Logic\u201d app) to programmatically change anything in the customer e-mail that goes out of the Manage Electronic Document app.",

Where the e-mail is built  \n   \u2022 Every time you press \u201cSend E-mail\u201d (or the process sends it automatically) the framework calls  \n     CL_EDOCUMENT\u2026->SEND_EMAIL_TO_CUST \u2192 CL_EDOC_UTIL=>SEND_EMAIL.  \n   \u2022 Just before the e-mail is handed over, the framework looks for the cloud BAdI  \n     \u2013 EDOC_PART_CONN_CHANGE_EMAIL_V2 (new, preferred)  \n     \u2013 EDOC_PART_CONN_CHANGE_EMAIL      (old, still called if V2 has no implementation)  \n     (see the ABAP extract returned by the tool call \u2013 lines \u201cGET BADI lo_part_conn_cloud_v2 \u2026\u201d).  \n   \u2022 If you provide an implementation, the method CHANGE_EMAIL_TO_CUSTOMER is executed and you\n     can overwrite almost every field of the message (sender, recipients, subject, body, language,\n     sensitivity, virus-scan profile, attachments, \u201csend immediately\u201d flag, \u2026).  \n\n2. What you are allowed to change in a Public-Cloud system  \n   \u2022 You cannot modify the standard classes, but the BAdI is released for key-user\n     (In-App/Extensibility) coding.  \n   \u2022 No classic SO10 mail forms exist \u2013 the BAdI is the single enhancement point.  \n   \u2022 Attachment size and number are still checked by the framework (\u2264 10 MB total).  \n\nHOW-TO STEPS  \n1. Open app \u201cCustom Logic\u201d (or \u201cBusiness Add-Ins (BAdI)\u201d in the Extensibility catalog).  \n2. Search for BAdI name \u201cEDOC_PART_CONN_CHANGE_EMAIL_V2 \u2013 Change e-mail to customer (v2)\u201d.  \n3. Create a new implementation.  \n4. Maintain the filter values:  \n   \u2022 Country             \u2013 the country of the eDocument you want to influence (e.g. \u201cBR\u201d).  \n   \u2022 Generic Filter      \u2013 only if you use more than one interface connector; otherwise \u2018*\u2019.  \n5.

    "generated_answer": "Technical explanation (step-by-step)\n\n1. Prerequisites  \n   \u2022 Your S/4HANA Public-Cloud tenant is enabled for \u201cDeveloper Extensibility\u201d and you log on with a user that has the role SAP_BR_DEVELOPER.  \n   \u2022 Latest ADT (Eclipse) plug-in is installed and an ABAP Cloud Project is created that points to the client 080 (development client) of the tenant.\n\n2. Create the enhancement implementation in ADT  \n   a. In the Project Explorer choose: New  \u2192  ABAP Repository Object  \u2192  Enhancement Implementation.  \n   b. Enhancement Spot     : ES_EDOC_PARTNER_CONNECTOR  \n   c. BAdI Definition      : EDOC_PART_CONN_CHANGE_EMAIL_V2  \n   d. Implementation Name  : Z_EDOC_PART_CONN_CHANGE_EML_V2 (or any Z* / Y* name)  \n   e. Short Text           : \u201cChange e-mail generated by eDocument Partner Connector\u201d.  \n   f. Package              : Your local package (e.g., ZLOCAL) and transport request.  \n   ADT generates a new class (e.g., ZCL_EDOC_PART_CONN_CHG_EML_V2) that already implements interface IF_EDC_PART_CONN_CHANGE_EMAIL (same interface is used in *\u2026_V2*).\n\n3. Maintain filter values (mandatory for the framework to call your implementation)  \n   \u2022 COUNTRY      (EDOCUMENT-LAND): e.g., \u201cDE\u201d \u2013 or \u201c*\u201d for all countries.  \n   \u2022 GENERIC_FILT (generic_filter) : blank or your own distinguishing value if you have more than one implementation.  \n   You enter the values in the \u201cEnh. Implementation \u2192 Filters\u201d tab in ADT and activate.\n\n4. Implement method CHANGE_EMAIL  \n   ADT created a stub for IF_EDC_PART_CONN_CHANGE_EMAIL~CHANGE_EMAIL.  \n   Use SAP\u2019s delivered example class CL_EDC_PART_CONN_CHANGE_EMAIL as a template (tool output excerpt):\n\n```abap\nMETHOD if_edc_part_conn_change_email~change_email.\n  DATA: lv_sender       LIKE LINE OF companyemailaddresses,\n        lv_recipient_to LIKE LINE OF customeremailaddresses,\n        ls_content_line LIKE LINE OF emailcontenttext.\n\n* Sender (first company e-mail maintained in T001/ADR6)\n  READ TABLE companyemailaddresses INTO lv_sender INDEX 1.\n  emailsender = lv_sender-smtp_addr.\n\n* Recipients (all customer e-mails)\n  LOOP AT customeremailaddresses INTO lv_recipient_to.\n    APPEND lv_recipient_to-smtp_addr TO emailrecipientsto.\n  ENDLOOP.\n\n* Subject\n  CONCATENATE 'Invoice' edocument-source_key INTO emailsubject SEPARATED BY space.\n\n* Body (255 char per line)\n  ls_content_line = 'Dear Customer,'.\n  APPEND ls_content_line TO emailcontenttext.\n  ls_content_line = 'Please find your electronic invoice attached.'.\n  APPEND ls_content_line TO emailcontenttext.\n\nENDMETHOD.\n```\n\n   \u2013 You can also fill optional CHANGING parameters (attachments, language, importance, send-immediately flag, etc.).  \n   \u2013 Do not raise exceptions; instead return an explanatory text in parameter ERROR_TEXT (if you fill it, the framework logs it and stops processing).\n\n5. Activate the implementation  \n   Activate the class and the enhancement implementation. Activation is automatically saved in your transport request and will flow through SAP Cloud Transport Management when released.\n\n6. Test  \n   \u2022 Open the Fiori app \u201cManage Electronic Documents\u201d.  \n   \u2022 Select an eDocument that should send an e-mail (\u201cSend to Partner\u201d action).  \n   \u2022 The framework calls your BAdI implementation; verify that sender, recipients, subject and text are set as expected.  \n   \u2022 Check application log (app \u201cDisplay Application Log\u201d) object EDOCUMENT for any ERROR_TEXT returned by the BAdI.\n\n7. Move to production  \n   Export the transport via \u201cExport Software Collection\u201d tile and import in the target tenant. No additional configuration is required because the filter values are stored in the enhancement implementation itself.\n\nOne-sentence plain-language summary  \nCreate a new enhancement implementation for BAdI EDOC_PART_CONN_CHANGE_EMAIL_V2 in Eclipse, maintain the country/filter values, code your logic in method CHANGE_EMAIL (copying SAP\u2019s sample class), activate and transport\u2014the framework then calls your code to change sender, recipients, subject and content of the e-mail that the eDocument partner connector sends.",

    "generated_answer": "Technical explanation (key facts coming from the code search)  \n\u2022 Every \u201cpublic-cloud\u201d DRC process looks-up the technical route for an outbound call in one of two places:  \n  \u2013 Class CL_EDOC_UTIL_EU \u2192 method GET_COMMUNICATION_SCENARIO (for EU-type processes).  \n  \u2013 Country/region-specific class that implements IF_EDOC_LAC_COMM \u2192 method IF_EDOC_LAC_COMM~GET_COMMUNICATION_DATA (e.g. CL_EDOC_LAC_COMM_CO, \u2026).  \n  These methods return a structure that contains four fields which together define a communication interface for DRC in SAP S/4HANA Cloud:  \n      interface_id   (e.g. \u2018CO_INVOICE_TRANSM\u2019)  \n      version        (numeric, 0001 \u2026)  \n      scenario_id    (a Communication Scenario, e.g. \u2018SAP_COM_0670\u2019)  \n      service_id     (service inside the scenario, e.g. \u20180001\u2019)  \n\n\u2022 When a new custom process is created you therefore have to make sure that the same four data points exist (and match) in both \u2013 the ABAP layer and the Communication\u2010Management layer of the tenant.\n\nStep-by-step procedure to \u201cDefine Communication Interface in Public\u201d for a new custom DRC process  \n1. Design the interface parameters  \n   \u2013 Decide on an Interface ID (18 chars max, UPPER-CASE, no spaces).  \n   \u2013 Decide how many versions you will need (normally start with 0001).  \n   \u2013 Decide which outbound technology you will use (SOAP / REST).  \n2. Create the Communication Scenario (UI: \u201cCustom Communication Scenarios\u201d)  \n   a. Include each outbound service you need.  \n   b. Publish the scenario \u2192 this yields a Scenario-ID ( \u2018Z_\u2026\u2019 if you create it yourself).  \n   c. Each service created in the scenario receives a Service-ID (0001, 0002 \u2026).  \n3. Create a Communication System (UI: \u201cCommunication Systems\u201d)  \n   \u2013 Enter host, port, authentication method for your external platform.  \n4. Create a Communication Arrangement (UI: \u201cCommunication Arrangements\u201d)  \n   \u2013 Base it on the scenario you made in step 2.  \n   \u2013 Bind the services to the system from step 3.  \n   \u2013 Note the logical port (= generated outbound service name).  \n5. Register the interface on the ABAP side (Configuration activity \u201cDefine Interface\u201d \u2013 SSCUI 106641)  \n   \u2013 Enter Interface-ID, Version and mark it as \u201cPublic\u201d.  \n   \u2013 Specify technology (SOAP / REST), HTTP method, relative URL path, MIME type, etc.  \n6. Map interface \u2194 process step (Configuration activity \u201cAssign Interface to Process Step\u201d \u2013 SSCUI 106642).  \n7. Tell the runtime which Communication Scenario / Service to use  \n   (the part proven by the code snippets above)  \n   \u2013 Add a record to the IF_EDOC_LAC_COMM implementation that belongs to your country/cluster.  \n     Example (pattern taken from CL_EDOC_LAC_COMM_CO):  \n       result = VALUE ts_comm_data(  \n          ( interface_id = \u2018Z_MY_CUSTOM_TRANSM\u2019  \n            version      = 0001  \n            service_id   = 0001  \n            scenario_id  = \u2018Z_MY_SCENARIO\u2019 ) ).  \n   \u2013 If your process is EU-type, instead extend the internal table GT_COMMUNICATION_SCENARIO inside CL_EDOC_UTIL_EU~GET_COMMUNICATION_SCENARIO in exactly the same way.  \n8. Transport / deploy the enhancement to your Quality & Production tenants.  \n9. Test the call with \u201cPreview XML / Test Run\u201d in the Manage Electronic Documents app \u2013 the system now resolves:  \n   Process step \u2192 Interface ID/Version \u2192 Scenario/Service \u2192 Logical-Port \u2192 actual endpoint.\n\nShort example snippet (taken from CL_EDOC_LAC_COMM_CO)  \n  result = VALUE #(  \n      ( interface_id = \u2018CO_INVOICE_TRANSM\u2019      version = 0001  \n        service_id  = 0001  scenario_id = \u2018SAP_COM_0670\u2019 ) ).\n\nPlain-language summary  \nIn public-cloud DRC you first build a Communication Scenario/Arrangement in the UI, then register the same IDs in configuration (Define Interface + Assign Interface) and finally expose them to the runtime by adding one line of ABAP mapping (interface-id \u2192 scenario/service). Once those four values line up, your new custom process can reach the external platform.",

Check authorizations  \n   \u2022 User must have business role BR_DRC_CONFIG (or a custom role containing the same _DRC Process Configuration_ catalog).  \n   \u2022 If you will upload test files or simulate, add BR_DRC_EXPERT.\n\n2. Prepare master data  \n   \u2022 Make sure the Italian company code is assigned to a Reporting Entity in app \u201cManage Reporting Entities\u201d.  \n   \u2022 Verify tax numbers and digital address (Codice Destinatario) are maintained for the entity; these are reused by DRC run-time.  \n\n3. Open the configuration cockpit  \n   \u2022 Launch Fiori app \u201cDefine Compliance Processes\u201d.  \n   \u2022 Click + Create \u2192 choose \u201cProcess\u201d and enter:  \n       \u2013 Process ID (technical key, e.g. ZIT_FPA_OUT)  \n       \u2013 Description (e.g. \u201cFatturaPA Outbound Italy\u201d)  \n       \u2013 Country/Region = IT  \n       \u2013 Process Type = Outbound (or Inbound if relevant)\n\n4. Start with an empty version  \n   \u2022 The system creates Version 001 automatically. You may copy an SAP-delivered template (e.g. BUS_IT_FPA) instead of starting blank; this keeps the process extensible yet linked to SAP updates.  \n\n5. Define Extraction step (\u201cData Source\u201d)  \n   \u2022 Tab \u201cExtraction\u201d: select CDS view or RAP query delivering the raw data.  \n   \u2022 For invoices you can reference I_BILLINGDOCJEE or your own custom CDS created in key-user extensibility (\u201cCustom CDS Views\u201d).  \n   \u2022 Enter selection parameters to expose on the run screen (company code, fiscal year, document number, etc.).\n\n6. Add Transformation / Mapping  \n   \u2022 Tab \u201cTransformation\u201d: choose Mapping Type = Mapping Logic.  \n   \u2022 If you copied an SAP process the delivered XSLT/BRF+ rule is already listed; otherwise upload your own XSLT or maintain a BRF+ function that converts the extraction structure to the Italian FatturaPA XML (or whatever custom layout you need).  \n\n7. Configure Validation (optional but common)  \n   \u2022 Tab \u201cValidation\u201d: point to CDS or BRF+ function that performs Italian e-invoicing checks (mandatory tags, decimal formats, etc.).  \n   \u2022 Set severity (Error/Warning) so that incorrect documents are blocked before submission.\n\n8. Output Definition  \n   \u2022 Tab \u201cOutput Handling\u201d:  \n       \u2013 Output Channel = PEPPOL/SDI/External System/File Download depending on customer landscape.  \n       \u2013 Define file naming convention, compression, or e-mail destination if using e-mail adapter.  \n       \u2013 For Public Cloud you normally pick \u201cCommunication Arrangement\u201d and reference SAP Document Compliance, Italy (SAP_COM_0601).  \n\n9. Assign Process to Reporting Entity  \n   \u2022 Switch to app \u201cAssign Processes to Reporting Entities\u201d.  \n   \u2022 Select your Italian entity and tick the newly created process/version 001 so that it appears in run cockpit.\n\n10. Transport to Q and P systems  \n   \u2022 In Public Cloud, configuration is recorded automatically. Use \u201cExport / Import Compliance Content\u201d to move from Dev tenant to Test \u2192 Prod.\n\n11. Test run  \n   \u2022 Open \u201cRun Compliance Processes\u201d.  \n   \u2022 Filter by entity and your new process.  \n   \u2022 Execute with a small selection; verify extraction log, mapping result, and produced XML in the \u201cMessages\u201d section.  \n\n12. Activate for production  \n   \u2022 When results are correct, set the process version status to \u201cReleased\u201d in Define Compliance Processes.  \n   \u2022 Schedule a job via \u201cSchedule Compliance Jobs\u201d or integrate with SD billing output to trigger the DRC run automatically.\n\nPlain-language summary  \nCreate the new Italian process in the \u201cDefine Compliance Processes\u201d Fiori app, point it to the data source, mapping, validation, and output you need, then link it to your Italian reporting entity and test; once it runs correctly, release and transport it to production.",

Create the implementation class  \n   \u2022 In Eclipse/ADT choose File \u2192 New \u2192 ABAP Class.  \n   \u2022 Name it ZCL_DRC_XX_COUNTRY (XX = ISO code).  \n   \u2022 Set Super-Class to CL_DRC_EX_COUNTRY_HDLR (standard abstract class that contains all default hooks).  \n   \u2022 No additional interface declaration is needed; the super class already defines every exit method (BUILD_HEADER, BUILD_SUPPLIER_NODE, MAP_TAXES, AFTER_SIGNATURE, etc.).  \n\n2. Override only the exits you really need  \n   \u2022 Redefine the relevant protected methods; leave the others untouched so the framework keeps the SAP default logic. Example:  \n     METHOD build_supplier_node.  \n       super->build_supplier_node( ).       \"keeps common logic  \n       \u201c\u2013\u2013 country specific add-ons  \n       lr_xml->add_attribute( iv_name = 'State' iv_value = 'DF' ).  \n     ENDMETHOD.  \n\n3. Transport class to the tenant  \n   \u2022 Use gCTS to commit & push to the central repository.  \n   \u2022 In Public Cloud the transport container is released automatically once the change is pushed.  \n\n4. Register the handler for the country/region in the \u201cManage DRC Extensibility\u201d app  \n   \u2022 Go to SAP Fiori tile \u201cDocument and Reporting Compliance \u2013 Extensibility\u201d.  \n   \u2022 Choose \u201cCountry/Region Handlers\u201d \u2192 \u201cNew\u201d.  \n   \u2022 Enter:  \n     \u2011 Country/Region = BR (example)  \n     \u2011 Business Process = E-Invoicing (EDOC) or Reporting as required  \n     \u2011 Class Name = ZCL_DRC_BR_COUNTRY  \n   \u2022 Save and activate; the framework now calls your class whenever it processes documents for that country.  \n\n5. (Optional) Provide test data variants  \n   \u2022 In the same app choose \u201cSimulation Variants\u201d and assign your class to XML test files; this lets you run the built-in simulator without posting real documents.  \n\n6. Life-cycle tasks  \n   \u2022 Versioning \u2013 Create new inactive versions when legal rules change; activate at go-live date.  \n   \u2022 Regression \u2013 Use the built-in unit-test class that comes with CL_DRC_EX_COUNTRY_HDLR; simply redefine IF_DRC_TEST~RUN.  \n\nPlain-language summary  \nCreate a subclass of SAP\u2019s standard country-handler base class, override only the mapping methods you need, transport it, and register the class for the desired country in the \u201cManage DRC Extensibility\u201d Fiori app\u2014then the Public-Cloud DRC framework will automatically run your logic for all documents of that country.",

Alignment with expert answer: The generated answer covers the main steps mentioned in the expert answer, such as creating an enhancement implementation, implementing the BAdI, setting a filter for Spain, and activating the implementation. This shows good coverage of the core requirements.\n\n2. Additional details: The generated answer provides more detailed steps and explanations than the expert answer, which is generally helpful. It includes information about prerequisites, specific class naming, and the use of the Custom Logic app, which are not mentioned in the expert answer but are relevant to the implementation process.\n\n3.

Public Cloud specifics: The answer correctly addresses the Public Cloud context by mentioning the ABAP environment (Steampunk) and the use of the Custom Logic app, which are specific to the cloud implementation.\n\n5. Discrepancies:\n   - The generated answer suggests creating a new class (ZCL_EDOCUMENT_ES_CUST) and returning its name in the BAdI implementation. While this approach can work, it's not explicitly mentioned in the expert answer or the tool output, which focus more on implementing the BAdI directly.\n   - The answer mentions SSCUI 104311 and the \"Manage Electronic Document Extensibility\" app, which are not referenced in the expert answer or the tool output. While these might be relevant, their inclusion without confirmation from the provided sources raises questions about their necessity in the Public Cloud context.\n\n6. Omissions:\n   - The generated answer doesn't mention the EDOCUMENT_INT_CONN_EXT BAdI for web service communication, which is mentioned in the tool output as an important step for sending and receiving electronic documents.\n   - It doesn't explicitly mention the use of CL_EDOCUMENT_EXT_ES class for Spain-specific requirements, which is highlighted in the tool output.\n\nIn conclusion, while the generated answer provides valuable and mostly accurate information, it includes some details that are not verified by the given sources and omits some important points mentioned in the tool output.

Completeness: The answer provides a complete implementation of the BAdI EDOCUMENT_BASE_EXT, including the BAdI class, the eDocument class, and instructions for registering the BAdI implementation. This goes beyond the expert answer, which only provided a basic structure.\n\n2. Accuracy: The implementation aligns with the information provided by the sap_documentation_summary tool. It correctly implements the IF_EDOCUMENT_BASE_EXT interface and the required methods (DETERMINE_EDOCUMENT_CLASS).\n\n3. Public Cloud Specificity: The answer explicitly states that it's for S/4HANA Public Cloud 2308 or higher and uses only released objects, which is crucial for Public Cloud implementations.\n\n4. Detailed Explanation: The answer includes a technical explanation of how the BAdI works, including the framework's execution in CL_EDOCUMENT_EXT\u2192CONSTRUCTOR.\n\n5. Code Quality: The provided code is well-structured, includes comments, and demonstrates best practices for ABAP in the cloud.\n\n6. Additional Context: The answer goes beyond the basic implementation by explaining what else is required (creating the customer class, registering the BAdI implementation, and adding the new class to the EDOEXTCOUNTRYCLS table).\n\n7.

    "generated_answer": "Technical explanation  \n\u2022 For most countries SAP provides a country-specific BAdI (e.g. EDOC_IT_XML_FILE, EDOC_HU_XML_FILE, EDOC_CH_XML_FILE) that is explicitly called in the mapping classes via methods CALL_BADI_XML_FILE / CALL_CLOUD_BADIS just before the XML is handed over to the interface layer (see e.g. cl_edoc_map_it-call_badi_xml_file).  \n\u2022 A codebase search over all *GR* (Greece) mapping and interface classes \u2013 cl_edoc_map_gr_*, cl_edocument_gr, cl_edoc_intf_conn_gr \u2013 shows **no** invocation of those BAdI helper methods, nor any Greece-specific \u201cEDOC_GR_XML_FILE\u201d BAdI definition.  \n\u2022 Consequently, in the Greece customer-invoice flow the XML is produced in cl_edocument_gr\u2192generate_xml and is forwarded directly to CI/CPI; there is no enhancement spot where customer code can be injected.  \n\u2022 SAP intentionally keeps the Greece (\u201cAADE MyDATA\u201d) payload locked because even minor structure changes make the document fail AADE validation. Enhancement options are therefore restricted to:  \n  \u2013 Changing values through standard configuration (e.g. VAT mapping tables, document types).  \n  \u2013 Post-processing in SAP Cloud Integration (mapping step) \u2013 outside the ERP system.  \n  \u2013 Adding files to the eDocument (add_xml_to_edocumentfile) after submission, which does not alter the transmitted XML.\n\nAnswer to the question  \nNo \u2013 inside SAP ERP/S/4HANA you cannot enhance or extend the Greece customer-invoice XML before it is sent to the authorities. Unlike other countries, the Greece solution has no BAdI or user-exit for XML manipulation; any alterations would have to be done externally in the middleware, not in the ERP XML generator.\n\nPlain-language summary  \nSAP deliberately offers no user exit to change the Greece e-invoice XML; you would need to keep the standard XML or adjust it later in CPI, but not within the ERP system itself.",

    "generated_answer": "Technical explanation (Private Cloud):\n\n1. Where the framework looks for extra files  \n   \u2022 Every country-specific mapping class contains a routine named call_badi_attachment (see class CL_EDOC_MAP_IT, line \u201c\u2026 CALL BADI lo_conn_cloud_it->fill_attachment \u2026\u201d, tool output above).  \n   \u2022 The routine is executed automatically when the XML is built.  \n   \u2022 If a Cloud BAdI implementation exists, its return table is read and each entry is converted into an EDOCUMENTFILE record by helper method _prepare_edocument_file from class CL_EDOC_CO_SEND_CUST_ATTACH.  \n   \u2022 The resulting record is stored in table EDOCUMENTFILE and embedded in the XML as an <Attachment> / <AdditionalDocumentReference> element before the file is sent.\n\n2. What you have to do  \n   a. Open the \u201cCustom Logic\u201d Fiori app (or transaction SCFD_EUI) and create an implementation of the Cloud BAdI that is offered for your country:  \n      \u2013 Italy         : BAdI name EDOC_IT_ATTACHMENT  \n      \u2013 Colombia   : EDOC_CO_ATTACHMENT  \n      \u2013 UBL 2.1 generic: EDOC_CO_SEND_CUST_ATTACH, etc.  \n      (The BAdI names correspond 1:1 to the classes found in the code search above.)  \n\n   b. Implement method FILL_ATTACHMENT.  \n      Interface types are delivered in package EDOCUMENT_xx (see IF_EDOC_IT_CLOUD_DATATYPES):  \n\n      CHANGING attachments TYPE mty_allegati_t      \"table delivered by SAP  \n\n      Sample implementation:  \n\n      DATA ls_att TYPE if_edoc_it_cloud_datatypes=>mty_allegati_s.  \n      ls_att-nome_attachment      = \u2018InvoiceScan.pdf\u2019.  \n      ls_att-formato_attachment   = \u2018PDF\u2019.            \"shown in XML  \n      ls_att-attachment_base64    = cl_http_utility=>encode_base64( my_pdf_xstring ).  \n      APPEND ls_att TO attachments.  \n\n      RETURN.  \n\n   c. Activate the BAdI implementation.\n\n3. Runtime result  \n   \u2022 During XML creation the framework calls your BAdI, receives table ATTACHMENTS, converts the Base64 payload into an xstring, and runs method attach_file (CL_EDOCUMENT_BR_IN) to insert the entry into EDOCUMENTFILE.  \n   \u2022 The entry is picked up by the mapping routine and inserted into the outgoing XML under the node prescribed by the local standard (Allegati, AdditionalDocumentReference, etc.).  \n   \u2022 The file is therefore sent together with the main XML through the standard transmission channel (PEPPOL, SDI, etc.).\n\nMinimal working example (Italy, FatturaPA):\n\nMETHOD if_ex_edoc_it_attachment~fill_attachment.  \n  DATA ls_att TYPE if_edoc_it_cloud_datatypes=>mty_allegati_s.  \n  ls_att-nome_attachment        = \u2018Contract123.pdf\u2019.  \n  ls_att-formato_attachment     = \u2018PDF\u2019.  \n  ls_att-descrizione_attachment = \u2018Signed contract\u2019.  \n  ls_att-attachment_base64      = cl_http_utility=>encode_base64( lv_contract_xstring ).  \n  APPEND ls_att TO attachments.  \nENDMETHOD.\n\nOne-sentence summary:  \nIn a Private-Cloud system you add extra files to the standard XML by creating a Cloud BAdI implementation (e.g. EDOC_IT_ATTACHMENT) that returns the files in Base64; the Document & Reporting Compliance framework automatically converts them into EDOCUMENTFILE entries and embeds them in the outgoing XML.",

Relevance: The question specifically asks about steps to enhance the generated XML for a Greece customer in Private Cloud using ADT. However, the generated answer concludes that it's not possible to enhance the XML in this scenario, which contradicts the premise of the question and the expert answer.\n\n2. Accuracy: While the generated answer provides some technical information about the Greek e-Invoicing code, it doesn't align with the expert answer, which outlines specific steps to enhance the XML using ADT.\n\n3. Completeness: The generated answer fails to provide any steps for enhancing the XML, which is the core of the question. Instead, it focuses on explaining why it can't be done, which is not supported by the expert answer or the question context.\n\n4. Contradiction: The generated answer directly contradicts the expert answer by stating that \"you simply cannot enhance the Greece (myDATA) XML via ADT,\" while the expert answer provides a detailed step-by-step process for doing exactly that.\n\n5. Misinterpretation: The answer seems to have misinterpreted the capabilities of the system or the scope of the question, leading to an incorrect conclusion about the impossibility of enhancing the XML.\n\nIn summary, the generated answer is not helpful as it fails to address the question, contradicts the expert answer, and provides no actionable steps for the user.

In a Private-Cloud (PCE) tenant the source code of CL_EDOCUMENT_GR is locked, and enhancement spots are restricted to the officially released Cloud BAdIs.

    "generated_answer": "Technical explanation (SAP S/4HANA Cloud, public edition \u2013 Electronic Document Processing):\n\n1. Scope & activate the framework  \n   \u2022 In SAP Central Business Configuration select the scope item 5XK (Electronic Document Processing) and the relevant communication scenarios (e.g. SAP_COM_0632 for Peppol).  \n   \u2022 Perform the automatic transport to the test tenant; this creates the service keys and communication arrangements that the runtime will use.\n\n2. Create the electronic-document process shell  \n   \u2022 Fiori app \u201cDefine Electronic Document Processing \u2013 Process\u201d \u2192 Create.  \n   \u2022 Enter Process ID/version, legal country, runtime class (=EDP standard), and the business document that will trigger it (e.g. SD billing).  \n   \u2022 The runtime will later pick up the correct implementation with method determine_process (see code excerpt returned from the tool for class CL_EDOCUMENT_PE \u2192 it sets ms_edocument-process according to EDOC_TYPE).\n\n3. Describe the source document  \n   \u2022 In the same app choose \u201cDocument Definition\u201d and specify the source business object, selection criteria, key fields, and event (Posting, Change, Cancellation).\n\n4. Design the target structure  \n   \u2022 Open Segment Designer to create the target message structure (XML/JSON/UBL).  \n   \u2022 Define segments, fields, cardinality, and generate the JSON schema (saved as a segment version).\n\n5. Map source to target  \n   \u2022 Launch Mapping Designer \u2192 create a mapping version; drag-and-drop or expression-map source fields to target segments.  \n   \u2022 Where logic is too complex, implement enhancement spot EDOCUMENT_MAPPER (BAdI EDM_MAPPER) in ABAP Cloud to calculate or enrich data.\n\n6. Add validations & enrichment rules  \n   \u2022 Configure rule sets in the \u201cValidation Rules\u201d tab or implement BAdI EDM_VALIDATION for advanced checks.  \n   \u2022 Optional: BAdI EDM_POST_PROCESS for final enrichment (e.g. digital signature).\n\n7. Define the output & submission step  \n   \u2022 In the Process canvas add a \u201cSubmission\u201d node and choose:  \n     \u2013 Peppol Adapter (out-of-box)  \n     \u2013 Generic HTTP, SFTP, SAP Document and Reporting Compliance service, etc.  \n   \u2022 Maintain the corresponding Communication Arrangement (user, certificate, endpoint) created in step 1.\n\n8. Assign scope & activate  \n   \u2022 In \u201cProcess Usage\u201d assign company codes, plants, or sales orgs that must run this process.  \n   \u2022 Activate the process (status = Released); the framework stores the version in table EDOCPROCESS and makes it selectable for runtime.\n\n9. Test in the test tenant  \n   \u2022 Post an SD/FI document \u2192 check \u201cMonitor Electronic Documents\u201d.  \n   \u2022 Inspect mapping result (JSON/XML), validation messages, and submission log.  \n   \u2022 Adjust mappings or rules until status = \u201cSuccessful\u201d.\n\n10. Transport to production  \n    \u2022 Add the process, segment, mapping, and enhancement implementations to a Software Collection in the SAP Cloud Transport Management UI.  \n    \u2022 Export \u2192 Import into production tenant \u2192 activate.\n\n11. Operate & monitor  \n    \u2022 Schedule the job \u201cEDP: Process Electronic Documents\u201d (standard job template) if batch mode is required.  \n    \u2022 Use \u201cMonitor Electronic Documents\u201d and alerting to supervise daily processing.\n\nShort examples from tool output  \n\u2022 Class CL_EDOCUMENT_PE \u2013 method DETERMINE_PROCESS  \n  \u2026 CASE ms_edocument-edoc_type. WHEN \u2018PE_BOLSUM\u2019. ms_edocument-process = \u2018PEBOLSYN\u2019. \u2026  \n  This illustrates how the runtime derives the correct process ID you defined in step 2.\n\nPlain-language summary:  \nEnable the scope item, create a new process in the \u201cDefine Electronic Document Processing\u201d app, model its source, target, mapping, validations, and submission, assign it to your company codes, test, then transport it to production\u2014after that every posted business document automatically generates and sends the required electronic document.",

    "generated_answer": "Technical root cause  \n1. With SAP Notes 3496530 + 3496562 the method CL_EDOC_UTIL_MY\u2192DETERMINE_EDOC_TYPE_INV_VERIF was enhanced.  \n2. For Invoice-Verification documents it now distinguishes four transaction indicators:  \n   1 = Invoice\u20032 = Credit Memo\u20033 = Subsequent Debit\u20034 = Subsequent Credit.  \n   (The indicator is set when field RSEG-TBTKZ = \u2018X\u2019.)  \n3. The routine then reads customizing table EDOCINVVER to convert the indicator into an eDocument type:  \n\n   ls_edoinvver = lo_edoc_config_db->select_edoinvver( iv_land = \u2018MY\u2019  \n                                                       iv_inv_tran = lv_inv_tran ).  \n\n   If no entry is found, rv_edoc_type stays INITIAL and the framework simply skips the eDocument creation \u2013 no error is raised, the CN is posted but no record appears in EDOC_COCKPIT.  \n\n4. After applying the notes you now post a \u201csubsequent credit\u201d (MR8M \u279c repost with \u201cSubsequent Credit\u201d flag).  \n   lv_inv_tran therefore = \u20184\u2019.  \n   Because transaction 4 was introduced only with the recent notes, the corresponding entry for Malaysia is still missing in EDOCINVVER, so the system has no eDocument type to create.\n\nFix / What to do  \n1. SPRO \u2192 Cross-Application Components \u2192 Document Compliance \u2192 Country/Region-Specific Functions \u2192 Malaysia \u2192 \u201cMaintain Transaction Types for Invoice Verification\u201d.  \n2. Insert (or adjust) the new line:  \n\n   Country = MY  \n   Transaction (INV_TRAN) = 4   \u201cSubsequent Credit\u201d  \n   eDocument Type        = MY_CRESF   (or the type you use for Credit Note; in most systems SAP delivers MY_CRE for standard CN and MY_CRESF for self-billing \u2013 choose the one that matches your scenario).  \n\n3. Save and transport.  \n4. Repeat the test: cancel, repost the subsequent credit; an entry is now created in EDOC_COCKPIT and the XML is generated.\n\nPlain-language summary  \nThe two SAP Notes added a new code (\u201c4 \u2013 Subsequent Credit\u201d) but the related customizing was not yet filled, so the system did not know which eDocument to create and silently skipped it; add the missing line in SPRO and the Credit-Note eDocs will be generated again.",

Accuracy: The generated answer correctly states that SAP has not yet released enablement notes for the new schema version 1.1. This aligns with the lack of information about version 1.1 in the SAP documentation summary we retrieved.\n\n2. Relevance: The answer provides relevant information about the current state of SAP's support for Malaysia e-Invoice and gives actionable advice on how to stay updated on future releases.\n\n3. Completeness: The generated answer goes beyond the specific question to provide context about the situation, which is helpful for the user's understanding.\n\n4.

The expert answer mentions this note as being available for all releases and supporting version 1.1, while the generated answer and our tool search found no information about this note.\n\n5. Missing information: The generated answer doesn't mention anything about digital signatures or the differences between versions 1.0 and 1.1, which the expert answer includes.\n\n6. Up-to-date information: The generated answer seems to be more current than the expert answer, as it mentions monitoring for updates rather than stating that version 1.1 is already supported.\n\nIn conclusion, while the generated answer provides valuable and seemingly more up-to-date information, it lacks some specific details mentioned in the expert answer and doesn't fully address the user's request for SAP Note details to update from version 1.0 to 1.1.

    "generated_answer": "Technical explanation  \n\u2022 Inside SAP Document & Reporting Compliance (DRC) the value for \u201cCustoms Form Reference Number\u201d in the XML/PDF is filled by the mapping class that is called for MM-based e-invoices.  \n\u2022 Your own \u201cCustom logic\u201d has been switched on (BAdI EDOC_MAP_MM* or Z-copy) so that it tries to read the text object IMPORT_TEXT_TYPE from the Purchase-Order header; if no text is found there it falls back to the MIGO header text.  \n\u2022 The Mexican/Peppol UBL element \u200b<cac:AdditionalDocumentReference><cbc:ID schemeID=\\\"CUO\\\" \u2026> is restricted by SAP to the regular expression  \n\u2003[A-Z0-9\\\\-\\\\.\\\\/_ ]{1,35}  \n(see constant IF_EDOC_XML_CONSTANTS=>MC_REGEX_DOC_NUMBER). Any other character (e.g. \u201c#\u201d, \u201c&\u201d, \u201c%\u201d, \u201c(\u201d, \u201c)\u201d, \u201c?\u201d or national letters such as \u201c\u00e1\u201d, \u201c\u00f6\u201d) leads to application-log error EDOCUMENT_MM 009 \u201cSpecial characters not allowed for Reference number of customs form\u201d and the XML/PDF is not rendered.\n\nWhy the error appears in your case  \n1. The PO header text field was left empty, therefore the enhancement logic reads the next available text line (MIGO header).  \n2. That text contains at least one character that is not in the allowed whitelist.  \n3. The mapping class rejects the value and raises the message; the outbound process is therefore stopped.\n\nHow to solve  \n\nOption A \u2013 Master data / process fix (recommended)  \n1. Maintain the correct Customs Reference in the PO header text type IMPORT_TEXT_TYPE (transaction ME22N \u2192 Header \u2192 Texts) and ensure it contains only letters, digits, hyphen, slash, dot or blank, max 35 chars, e.g.  \n\u2003\u201c2306-ABCD-987654\u201d  \n2. Remove any emojis, accents, \u201c&\u201d or similar from MIGO header texts so that even the fallback value is compliant.  \n3. Re-submit the invoice; XML and PDF will be created.\n\nOption B \u2013 Code fix (if the text cannot be cleaned)  \nEnhance your BAdI implementation and add a sanitation step before passing the value back to DRC:\n\n```\nDATA(lv_raw) = lt_text_lines[ 1 ]-tdline.\nDATA(lv_clean) = cl_abap_string_utilities=>replace_all(\n                   val = lv_raw\n                   sub = '[^A-Z0-9\\\\-\\\\./_ ]'\n                   with = ''   \"remove\n                   occ = cl_abap_regex=>all ).\nev_customs_ref = lv_clean(35).   \"truncate to 35\n```\n\nor simply call the SAP helper method (exists in most SP levels):\n\n```\nev_customs_ref = cl_edocument_util=>sanitize_doc_number( iv_value = lv_raw ).\n```\n\nOption C \u2013 Bypass check (NOT advised)  \nYou could switch message EDOCUMENT_MM 009 from \u201cE\u201d to \u201cW\u201d via transaction SE91, but this would produce non-compliant XML, so authorities or Peppol access points would reject it.\n\nChecklist of allowed characters  \nA B C \u2026 Z (uppercase only)  \n0 - 9  \nHyphen \u201c-\u201d, Slash \u201c/\u201d, Dot \u201c.\u201d, Underscore \u201c_\u201d, Blank\n\nCustomizing path for the text type used  \nSPRO \u2192 Materials Management \u2192 Purchasing \u2192 Purchase Order \u2192 Texts \u2192 Define Text Types for Header / Item.  \nConfirm that IMPORT_TEXT_TYPE is active for header level.\n\nPlain-language summary  \nThe e-invoice fails because the system copies a header text that contains illegal symbols into the \u201cCustoms Form Reference\u201d field; keep that text to simple letters/numbers (max 35 chars) or cleanse it in your enhancement, then resubmit the invoice.",

    "generated_answer": "Technical explanation\n\u2022 The two cockpit URLs you provided are Neo-environment subaccounts that lie under global account 38669bd2-\u2026\u200b.  \n\u2022 Uploading a \u201cP9Q\u201d (Peppol SMP Q-warrant) client-certificate requires the \u00adSubaccount Administrator or \u00adSecurity Administrator role in that Neo subaccount, not merely the role inside the Peppol Cloud application.  \n\u2022 Those roles can only be assigned by an existing Global-Account Administrator or by someone who already holds Subaccount-Admin on the same subaccount.  \n\u2022 In Neo the role assignment is performed in the cockpit, not in the Peppol Cloud dashboard, therefore your present application-level access is insufficient.\n\nHow to obtain the required access\n1. Identify a person who is already Global Account Admin for 38669bd2-43c3-485c-b1f3-60a369ed4ce8 (often the basis or infrastructure team that created the Neo account).  \n2. Ask that person to do ONE of the following for each subaccount (8c0dcfe8-\u2026 and 8dc60f96-\u2026):\n   a. Add your S-user or e-mail to the \u201cSubaccount Administrator\u201d cockpit role collection.  \n   \u2011 Cockpit \u2192 Global Account \u2192 Security \u2192 Administrators \u2192 \u201cAdd\u201d \u2192 choose user \u2192 assign \u201cSubaccount Administrator\u201d.  \n   OR  \n   b. Grant you \u201cSecurity Administrator\u201d which is sufficient for certificate/key store operations.  \n3. After the role is saved, log out/in once; you will now see the \u201cSecurity\u201d tile inside the subaccount cockpit.  \n4. Navigate: Subaccount \u2192 Security \u2192 Certificates & Keys \u2192 \u201cUpload\u201d \u2192 select the P9Q *.p12 or *.pfx file \u2192 enter the private-key password \u2192 Save.  \n5. Restart the Peppol Cloud Java/XS app (if required by your vendor guide) so that the runtime picks up the new certificate.\n\nIf no Global Account admin is known, raise a ticket with SAP BTP operations (component BC-NEO-CIS) quoting the global-account GUID and explicitly requesting that your user be made Subaccount Administrator; SAP will ask for authorisation from the commercial contact before acting.\n\nPlain-language summary\nYou don\u2019t yet have the right cockpit role; ask an existing global-account or subaccount admin to add your user as \u201cSubaccount Administrator\u201d (or \u201cSecurity Administrator\u201d) in those two Neo subaccounts, then you can upload the P9Q certificate yourself.",

If you want a different label or further checks, copy CL_EDOC_DCC_ACTION_WEBUI into your own Z-class, register that in EDOCACTION instead of the SAP class, and adapt as necessary.\n\n3. No SAP-standard option exists to show the PDF without such a custom action; storing it alone is not enough.\n\nPlain-language summary  \nSAP ships inbound eDocument cockpit with an HTML-viewer only; to view the original ZUGFeRD PDF you must add a DISPLAY_PDF action in the eDocument-action customizing (or create your own), after which a new \u201cPDF\u201d button will open the file you already attach to the PUSH-service.",

    "generated_answer": "Technical explanation  \nWhen an eDocument is generated from a Settlement-Management (SM) document the SAP framework runs the following checks in the delivered ABAP classes:\n\n\u2022 CL_IM_EDOC_STLMT \u2192 IF_EDOC_STLMT~CREATE_EDOCUMENT  \n\u20031. go_edoc_config_db->SELECT_EDOCOMPANYACTIV( iv_source_type = CL_EDOC_SOURCE_STLMT=>GC_SRC_STLMT_INV ).  \n\u2003\u2003\u2192 Entry must exist and be flagged Active for every company code that shall create an eDocument.  \n\u20032. CL_EDOC_SOURCE_STLMT builds the source payload and hands it over to CL_EDOC_MAP_CII for France-specific mapping (\u201cfill_settlement\u201d).  \n\u2022 CL_EDOC_SOURCE_STLMT~DETERMINE_EDOC_TYPE reads table EDOTMFK (go_edoc_config_db->SELECT_EDOTMFK) with keys Country = \u2018FR\u2019 and LFART (SM document type).  \n\u2003\u2192 The LFART must therefore be assigned to an eDocument type (for example FR_CII_INV / FR_CII_CRN).\n\nIf one of those two Customizing checks fails the method returns without creating the eDocument, therefore the process has to be enabled in Customizing \u2013 not in code.\n\nSteps to enable the new source type \u201cSettlement Management Documents\u201d for France e-Invoicing\n\n1. Software prerequisite  \n   \u2022 Apply the support package or SAP Notes that deliver the new source type and mapping classes (starting with SAP Note 3309831 and its prerequisites, or the corresponding SP in OP 2023/CE 2308 and higher).  \n   \u2022 Run SNOTE and SRTQC to make sure all objects (CL_EDOC_SOURCE_STLMT, CL_EDOC_MAP_CII enhancement, etc.) are present and active.\n\n2. Define/verify the source type (delivered automatically)  \n   IMG \u2192 SAP Document and Reporting Compliance \u2192 eDocument Framework \u2192 Source Types \u2192 Define Source Types  \n   \u2022 Check that source type code \u201cSTLMT_INV\u201d (text: \u201cSettlement Management Documents\u201d) exists and points to class CL_EDOC_SOURCE_STLMT.  \n   (Delivered by SAP; do not change anything.)\n\n3. Activate the source type per company code  \n   IMG \u2192 \u2026 \u2192 Activate eDocument for Company Code  \n   \u2022 Insert a new line for every French company code.  \n     Company Code = XXXX  \n     Source Type = STLMT_INV (Settlement Management Documents)  \n     Active\u2003\u2003= \u2611  \n\n   This fulfils the SELECT_EDOCOMPANYACTIV check in class CL_IM_EDOC_STLMT.\n\n4. Assign SM document types to an eDocument type  \n   IMG \u2192 SAP Document and Reporting Compliance \u2192 eInvoice France \u2192 Define eDocument Types (view V_EDOTMFK)  \n   \u2022 For country FR maintain at least the SM document types you use (field LFART, e.g. \u2018Z1\u2019, \u2018Z2\u2019).  \n   \u2022 Map them to the correct eDocument type, for example:  \n       FR\u2003Z1\u2003\u2192 FR_CII_INV\u2003(Invoice)  \n       FR\u2003Z2\u2003\u2192 FR_CII_CRN\u2003(Credit note)  \n   \u2022 Maintain number-range object and logical receiver if they are still initial.  \n   This fulfils the SELECT_EDOTMFK check in CL_EDOC_SOURCE_STLMT.\n\n5. (Optional) Maintain value mappings used in class CL_EDOC_MAP_CII  \n   IMG \u2192 eDocument Framework \u2192 Define Value Mappings  \n   \u2022 If your SM documents use special payment terms, tax exemptions, etc., add external value \u2194 internal value pairs so that \u201cfill_settlement\u201d can translate them into the CII structures.\n\n6. (Optional) Enhance the mapping  \n   If standard CII/UBL mapping is not sufficient, implement BAdI EDOC_FR_MAP_CII (or the generic BAdI EDOC_MAP_ENHANCE) to add or overwrite fields after SAP\u2019s mapping class has run.\n\n7. Test  \n   \u2022 Create an SM document (WB**N).  \n   \u2022 Save \u2013 an entry should be written to EDOCUMENT table automatically.  \n   \u2022 Open transaction EDOC_COCKPIT (or Fiori app \u201cMonitor eDocuments\u201d) \u2192 check that the document with source type \u201cSTLMT_INV\u201d and eDocument type FR_CII_INV/CRN is in status \u201cCreated\u201d.  \n   \u2022 Trigger the next process step (XML generation, Peppol submission, etc.) and verify the fields that come from method CL_EDOC_MAP_CII=>FILL_SETTLEMENT.\n\nPlain-language summary  \nInstall the latest SAP note/SP, switch on the new source type \u201cSettlement Management Documents\u201d for each French company code, and map your SM document types to a French e-Invoice eDocument type in Customizing; after that every new Settlement-Management document will automatically create an eDocument with the enhanced France mapping.",

If so, inherit from CL_EDOC_MAP_FR_B2B or CL_EDOC_MAP_CO_STLMT_UBL_21 and redefine the relevant MAP_* methods.\n\n5. Process determination (which FR process is chosen)  \n   \u2022 CL_EDOCUMENT_FR_INV->DETERMINE_PROCESS already contains a WHEN branch for CL_EDOC_SOURCE_STLMT=>GC_SRC_STLMT_INV and sets the proper process (e.g. FRB2BCINV or FRB2BSBINV) depending on KOART and BP status.\n\nSummary steps\n\n1.

No other method is necessary.  Should you later need specific behaviour\n   (e.g. special BillingReference rules for SM), add further REDEFINITIONs\n   in the same style.\n\nPlain-language summary\n======================\n\nCreate a new ABAP class CL_EDOC_MAP_FR_B2B_STLMT that simply inherits the\nexisting French B2B SD mapping class and tweaks two tiny places so it reads\nits data from the Settlement-Management header (KOMLFK).

The expert answer is much simpler and focuses solely on the settlement-management case, while the generated answer includes additional complexity that may not be necessary.\n\n2. The generated answer assumes the existence of certain methods (like read_doc_from_flow) that are not defined in the context, which might confuse the user.\n\n3.

Checks whether the source structure for a settlement-management document (`ms_source-komlfk`) exists and already carries a contract number (`KOMLFK-CONTRACT`).  \n2. If yes, that number is copied 1-to-1 into the outgoing eInvoice structure (`rs_contract-id-base-content`).  \n3. If not (classic SD invoice, credit memo \u2026), the original logic of the superclass is retained via `read_doc_from_flow`, which looks up a preceding outline agreement (VBFA-VBELV where VBFA-VBTYP_V = \u2018G\u2019).  \n4. The field is only filled when a value was actually found, keeping the XML lean and compliant.\n\nPlain-language summary  \nAdd the above method to your France-B2B settlement-mapping class; it first uses the settlement header field KOMLFK-CONTRACT and, if that is empty, automatically falls back to the standard SD contract search\u2014so the same mapping class works for both SD and settlement-management documents.",

In the redefinition you  \n   \u2022 call super->fill_note( ) to retrieve the two hard-coded penalty notes,  \n   \u2022 read the header text of the Settlement document with the helper READ_TEXT that already exists in the superclass,  \n   \u2022 append every line of that text to the resulting note table (RT_NOTE).  \n5.

Reads `IS_VBRP` from the Settlement Management billing doc and calculates a unit price (`LV_UNIT_PRICE`) by dividing the net amount (`NETWR`) by the billed quantity (`FKIMG`).  \n2. If the unit price has more than two decimals, it multiplies it by 10, 100, 1000 etc. and reports the corresponding `BaseQuantity` (EV_UNIT_QUAN) in the XML so that the transmitted price still uses two decimals as required by France B2B and Peppol.  \n3. Calls `FORMAT_NEGATIVE_AMOUNT` so that credit-memo positions are transferred with the proper \u201c\u2212\u201d sign representation required by the Business-to-Government specs.  \n4. Returns currency (`EV_CURRENCY`) unchanged from the header currency (VBRK-WAERK).\n\nPlain-language summary  \nAdd the above redefinition to your settlement-mapping subclass; it converts the net amount of a Settlement Management item into a compliant two-decimal unit price, applies the correct quantity scaling, and keeps the currency and sign handling required for the France B2B e-invoice file.",

The settlement document number (`KOMLFK-WBELN`) is taken as text name.  \n2. For each required text ID (FRRC, FRAD) the helper `read_text` (inherited from the superclass) retrieves all text lines that belong to text object `WBRK`.  \n3. Lines are concatenated into a string and stored in the receiver structure (`ms_party_receiver-*`).  \n4. Clearing variables between the two reads avoids wrong concatenation.\n\nPlain-language summary  \nCreate subclass CL_EDOC_MAP_FR_B2B_STLMT (or enhance the existing one) and copy the above method body: it fetches the routing code and the addressing-line code from settlement-management header texts (object WBRK) so that \u201cSettlement Management Documents\u201d become a supported source type in the French B2B e-invoice process.",

Choose Add BAdI Implementation and select EDOC_ADAPTOR_CLOUD.\n5. (Optional) Create a BAdI filter for Country and/or Generic Filter.\n6. Choose Implementing Class to create a new implementation class. The new implementation class automatically implements the interfaces if_badi_interfaces and if_edoc_adaptor_cloud.7. After generating the class, open the interface method and press F3 to view its parameters. To display the documentation, press F2.\n8. Implement the necessary logic in the method to modify the XML tags and fill optional XML tags with values such as customer material number or delivery number.9. Activate your BAdI implementation.When you display the XML file of the electronic document in the eDocument Cockpit or Manage Electronic Documents app, you will see that the relevant XML tags are now filled with the desired values.Please note that the provided steps are specific to enhancing the XML file for a German customer in Public Cloud using ADT.

The answer provides a practical solution by explaining how to use the \"Manage eDocument Settings\" app to deactivate eDocument creation for specific source types and company codes.\n2. It includes steps for implementation, testing, and explains the technical background of how the restriction works.\n\nShortcomings:\n1. The generated answer does not mention the use of ABAP Development Tools (ADT) or the creation of a BAdI implementation, which are central to the expert answer.\n2. It doesn't reference the enhancement spot ES_DOCUMENT_CLOUD or the BAdI EDOC_ADAPTOR_CLOUD, which are key elements in the expert answer.\n3. The approach suggested in the generated answer (using SSCUI 104083) is not mentioned in either the expert answer or the additional SAP documentation provided.\n\nThe SAP documentation summary suggests using the Custom Logic app and implementing specific BAdIs, which aligns more closely with the expert answer.

The BAdI EDOC_ADAPTOR is released for cloud-use (it sits in the EDOCUMENT compliance layer and is on SAP\u2019s \u201cgreen\u201d whitelist).  \n2. You implement it in ADT (package Z* or your customer package) via:\n      \u2013 New BAdI enhancement implementation for EDOC_ADAPTOR  \n      \u2013 Filter value iv_country = \u2018TR\u2019 (leave the optional \u201cGeneric BAdI Filter\u201d blank unless you need sub-variants).\n3. In method IF_EDOC_ADAPTOR~SET_OUTPUT_DATA you can read / change any field of CS_OUTPUT_DATA, e. g.:\n\n```abap\nMETHOD if_edoc_adaptor~set_output_data.\n\n  \"Example: add a free-text note to the header\n  DATA ls_note TYPE edo_tr_note.\n  ls_note-content = 'Special campaign 2024'.\n  APPEND ls_note TO cs_output_data-parameters\n                         -package\n                         -elements[ 1 ]   \"first element = invoice\n                         -element_list\n                         -invoice\n                         -notes.\nENDMETHOD.\n```\n\n4.

All connectivity for Document and Reporting Compliance (DRC) must use the whitelisted communication scenarios that SAP ships (e.g. SAP_COM_0479 for e-documents). Creation of a completely new DRC Process\u2014including its own proxy/web-service endpoint\u2014can only be done by SAP (via a new country/solution delivered in a quarterly release) or by a certified partner through the SAP Localization Toolkit for Partners. It is not an activity a public-cloud customer can perform in the tenant.\n\nWhat you can do as a customer  \n1. Identify whether SAP already delivers the required DRC process.  \n   \u2022 Check the SAP Help Portal \u2192 Document and Reporting Compliance \u2192 Country/Region\u2013specific.  \n2. If it exists, activate it in SSCUI \u201cDocument and Reporting Compliance: Activate Countries/Regions.\u201d  \n3. Create communication artefacts to call the standard outbound/inbound APIs:  \n   a. Create Communication User.  \n   b. Create Communication System (enter host of your middleware/PEPPOL Access Point).  \n   c. Create Communication Arrangement for scenario SAP_COM_0479 (or the scenario named in the country help).  \n   These steps expose the standard OData/SOAP service; no proxy creation is required.  \n4. If the required process does NOT exist, open a customer influence request or engage a certified partner; they must build the new process in their partner-development tenant and request SAP to ship it\u2014again, not something done directly in your productive tenant.\n\nPlain-language summary  \nBecause a public-cloud customer cannot develop or deploy ABAP objects, you cannot \u201ccreate a new proxy for a web service\u201d in DRC; instead you must use the standard communication scenarios SAP already provides, or ask SAP/partner to deliver a new process.",

The system needs this to know where to send the payload.  \n\u2022 Customizing separation \u2013 All customizing nodes in IMG (Assignment of logical system, Number ranges, Status profiles, Output determination, Archiving objects) are maintained per eDocument Type to keep one country/process from interfering with another.  \n\u2022 Extensibility anchor \u2013 When you create a \u201cnew process\u201d through the DRC extensibility worklist the wizard actually creates a copy (or a blank entry) of an eDocument Type. Only after it exists can you attach your own CDS extraction view, mapping artefacts and web-service endpoint.\n\nTherefore the first mandatory step of any custom DRC process is to register a new eDocument Type, even if you intend to reuse the same legal document class (e.g. FI invoice). Without it the framework would not have a key under which it can:  \n\u2013 store the generated JSON/XML payload;  \n\u2013 keep status updates;  \n\u2013 route the document to the correct outbound channel;  \n\u2013 retrieve the document again in the cockpit.\n\nPlain-language summary  \nYou need to create an eDocument Type because it is the master key that tells DRC what kind of electronic document you are building, how to build it, and where to send it; without that key the cockpit and runtime cannot store or process your new custom scenario.\n\nExample snippet (IMG path)  \nSPRO \u2192 Financial Accounting \u2192 Document & Reporting Compliance \u2192 eDocument \u2192 eDocument Type \u2192 Define eDocument Types  \nHere you create, for instance, Z_PEPP_INV for a custom Peppol invoice; only afterwards can you assign CDS view ZEDOC_PEP_INV_EXT and mapping ZBRF_PEP_INV etc.",

Provide a technical endpoint that the external system can call  \n   \u2022 Create a Communication System (App \u201cCommunication Systems\u201d) with host/IP of the external connector.  \n   \u2022 Create a Communication Arrangement for scenario  \n     \u2013 SAP_COM_0527  (Digital Docs \u2013 generic SOAP/REST) or  \n     \u2013 SAP_COM_0542  (Peppol Inbound) or the country-specific inbound scenario.  \n   \u2022 Assign the inbound user/service key that the external platform will use.  \n   \u2022 In most Private Cloud landscapes the arrangement exposes the URL \u2026/sap/bc/srt/xip/edoc_in (SOAP) or \u2026/sap/opu/odata/sap/edoc_in_srv (OData).\n\n3. Secure the channel  \n   \u2022 If the external system sits behind an on-prem firewall, open the route in SAP Cloud Connector and map the virtual host/port to the Logical System created above.  \n   \u2022 If the external provider transmits over AS2/AS4 (Peppol), upload the mutual TLS certificates in the \u201cManage Certificates\u201d Fiori app and reference them in the Communication Arrangement.\n\n4. Configure the eDocument application layer (what the system does with the XML once it arrives)  \n   \u2022 SSCUI \u201cDefine Document Types for eDocuments\u201d \u2013 create/extend the inbound type (e.g. INVOICE_IN) and assign a number range.  \n   \u2022 SSCUI \u201cMaintain Application Object Types\u201d \u2013 link the eDocument type to FI/MM object (BKPF, MIR7, etc.).  \n   \u2022 SSCUI \u201cMap Inbound Messages to eDocument Types\u201d \u2013 map the external MessageType/ProcessType that will be sent to the type defined above.  \n   \u2022 SSCUI \u201cAssign Interface Usage\u201d \u2013 tie the mapping variant (AIF structure, BRF+ or CPI iFlow) to the eDocument type.\n\n5. Company-specific master data  \n   \u2022 Maintain Business Place / Tax Registration Number (App \u201cManage Tax Numbers\u201d) so the incoming XML can be validated.  \n   \u2022 Make sure each company code has an issuing/receiving logical system and plant mapping if required by the localization.\n\n6. Optional automation connector  \n   \u2022 If you use \u201cIncoming Automation for eDocuments\u201d (CPI content package), activate the connector in app \u201cMaintain Incoming Automation Connectors\u201d and assign it to the company code.  \n   \u2022 The framework class CL_EDOC_INCOM_CONNECTOR (called from the method in point 1) checks this assignment before it sends the XML for automatic processing.\n\n7. Monitoring & test  \n   \u2022 Authorize users for Fiori apps \u201ceDocument Inbox\u201d (F2474) and \u201cApplication Interface Monitor\u201d (AIF).  \n   \u2022 Send a test payload; it should appear in the inbox with status \u201cReceived \u2013 Processing\u201d.\n\nOne-sentence plain-language summary  \nBefore an external platform can push electronic documents into an SAP S/4HANA Private Cloud tenant you must (1) switch on Document & Reporting Compliance for the target company codes, (2) create a secured Communication Arrangement that exposes the inbound service, and (3) finish the eDocument customizing that tells SAP which message type to expect and how to post it.",

Approach: Break down each category, verify against known SAP DR&C components (EDO_IN, EDO_OUT customizing), B2B message monitoring, and inbound Peppol configuration (service group PEPPOL_IN).

Assign the process to company codes and system connection  \n   \u2022 Methods such as CL_EDOCUMENT_IN_EINV\u2192DETERMINE_PROCESS read EDOCOMPPROCCOM to decide whether the (new) process version is active for a given company code and whether it should run with \u201cD\u201d (DRC Service) or \u201cR\u201d (on-premise) connection.  \n   \u2022 Hence you must:  \n     \u2013 Map the new process to at least one company code in EDOCOMPPROCCOM.  \n     \u2013 Enter the logical system / communication scenario so that DRC knows where to send the data.\n\n4.

    "generated_answer": "Technical explanation  \nYes. Even in SAP S/4HANA Cloud, private edition (formerly \u201cPrivate Cloud\u201d), the Italian eDocument Customer-Invoice process was built with \u201ccloud BAdIs\u201d that are released for customer use.  \nThe ABAP code of class CL_EDOC_MAP_IT (and its Spain/ESS counterparts) shows repeated calls such as:\n\n  GET BADI mv_cloudbadi_out_invc_change.  \n  \u2026->change_outgoing_invoice ( EXPORTING companycode \u2026 )\n\nand similar objects mv_cloudbadi_withholding_tax, mv_cloudbadi_attachment, mv_cloudbadi_xml_file, etc.  \nThe corresponding BAdI interfaces (e.g. IF_ESVF_OUTG_INVC_CHANGE, IF_FIESSII_OUTG_INVC_CHANGE) have empty default implementations, explicitly flagged in their interface description as \u201cExtension Point for Customers in SAP S/4HANA Cloud\u201d.  \nBecause the BAdIs are marked as \u201ccloud BAdI\u201d, they are:\n\n\u2022 Whitelisted \u2013 appear in the In-App Extensibility app \u201cCustom Logic\u201d (key user) or ADT BAdI enhancement spot search.  \n\u2022 Safe \u2013 only change/append permitted XML nodes, no low-level objects.  \n\u2022 Upgrade-stable \u2013 SAP keeps the interface signature, so your logic survives upgrades.\n\nTypical extension steps  \n1. In the Custom Logic Fiori app (or ADT), create an implementation for enhancement spot EDOC_IT_OUT_INV_CHANGE (exact spot name depends on release).  \n2. Choose interface IF_ESVF_OUTG_INVC_CHANGE~CHANGE_OUTGOING_INVOICE.  \n3. Fill the CHANGING parameters \u2013 for example:\n\nMETHOD if_esvf_outg_invc_change~change_outgoing_invoice.  \n  \"Add a free-text note into the XML  \n  CONCATENATE cv_invoice_header_txt | \u2018 \u2013 Internal Ref: \u2019 iv_billing_doc INTO cv_invoice_header_txt.  \nENDMETHOD.\n\n4. Activate and test \u2013 new eDocuments will contain the additional header text in the XML sent to SDI.\n\nLimitations / what you cannot change  \n\u2022 Mapping structures that are not exposed in the CHANGING parameters cannot be altered.  \n\u2022 Core status handling, transmission to SDI and archiving are SAP-controlled and not open for modification.  \n\u2022 Only those BAdIs visible in Custom Logic are allowed; classic Enhancement Framework techniques are blocked in Private Cloud.\n\nPlain-language answer  \nYes \u2013 as an Italian Private-Cloud customer you can enhance the electronic-invoicing (eDocument) process by implementing the released \u201ccloud BAdIs\u201d provided by SAP; they let you inject custom logic into the customer-invoice XML before it is generated or sent.",

    "generated_answer": "Technical explanation  \n\u2022 The Peppol customizing that SAP Document and Reporting Compliance writes to table EDOEU-PARTID (Manage EU Participant IDs app / IMG path: Document & Reporting Compliance \u2192 Peppol \u2192 EU Business Participant \u2192 Maintain Participant IDs) is cross-client.  \n  \u2013 Key fields are PARTICIPANT_SCHEME + PARTICIPANT_ID.  \n  \u2013 The table has a UNIQUE index on those two fields only \u2013 the client (MANDT) is not part of that index.  \n  \u2013 Therefore the same VAT-based participant (\u20189956:DE123456789\u2019) can be stored only once in the entire ABAP system, no matter how many clients you have.  \n\u2022 When you try to create the participant a second time, the framework issues message EDO_EU_PARTICIPANT 029 \u201cParticipant already exists\u201d, which you are seeing as an \u201cerror because of the same VAT-ID\u201d.\n\nWhat to do  \n1. Create the participant only once and reuse it.  \n   \u2013 After the first creation open app \u201cAssign Company Codes to Participants\u201d (or IMG: \u2026 \u2192 Assign Company Codes).  \n   \u2013 Add every company code that has to send invoices with that VAT number \u2013 including those that technically belong to different clients or systems (IS-U, S/4).  \n   \u2013 When the IS-U client sends an eInvoice it will look up the participant via RFC; no local duplicate is necessary.  \n\n2. If both systems must stay completely independent (no cross-system lookup) you need different Peppol identifiers, e.g.  \n   \u2022 System 1 (S/4): 9956:DE123456789   (\u201cEU VAT\u201d)  \n   \u2022 System 2 (IS-U): 0204:DE123456789 (\u201cOrganisation number\u201d)  \n   The business network sees them as two distinct participants although the numerical part is the same.  \n\n3. Long-term best practice is a single \u201ccentral DRC\u201d client hosting all Peppol/DRC customizing. Satellite systems (IS-U, other S/4) call the DRC client via RFC; only one participant per legal entity is then needed.\n\nShort examples  \n\u2022 Creating the participant once  \n\n  Manage EU Participant IDs  \n     Participant Scheme   Participant ID       Description  \n     9956                 DE123456789          Muster GmbH  \n\n  Assign Company Codes to Participants  \n     Participant         Company Code  \n     9956:DE123456789    1000            (S/4 company)  \n     9956:DE123456789    2000            (IS-U company)  \n\n\u2022 Attempting to create it again in another client  \n\n  \u2192 Message EDO_EU_PARTICIPANT 029 \u201cParticipant already exists\u201d (because UNIQUE index already occupied).  \n\nPlain-language summary  \nA Peppol participant ID is stored only once per entire ABAP system; instead of trying to create it again, add every company code that uses that VAT number to the existing participant, or\u2014if you really need two separate records\u2014use a different identification scheme for the second system.",

    "generated_answer": "Technical explanation\nThe status \u201cReceived by sender access point\u201d means that SAP Document and Reporting Compliance (formerly eDocument/Peppol Framework) managed to hand the XML to the Peppol Access Point, but the Access Point could not authenticate itself when it tried to forward the document to the next hop.  \nThe Access-Point answer is a plain HTTP 401 \u2013 \u201cUnauthorized\u201d \u2013 which is returned by the Peppol Service Metadata Publisher (SMP) of the receiver. In practice this 401 is triggered by one of three configuration errors in your cloud tenant or on-premise system:\n\n1. Expired or missing \u00adclient TLS certificate  \n   \u2022 In SPRO \u2192 Cross-Application Components \u2192 SAP Document and Reporting Compliance \u2192 Peppol \u2192 Maintain Certificates, the certificate defined under \u201cTransport Certificate (AP-to-AP)\u201d is either expired or not the one registered for your Peppol Participant ID.  \n   \u2022 Result: the receiver\u2019s Access Point rejects the mutual-TLS handshake and answers with 401.\n\n2. Wrong HTTP-basic/OAuth credentials in Communication Arrangement SAP_COM_0597 (or SAP_PEPPOL_ON_PREM)  \n   \u2022 If your AP is reached through an HTTP endpoint that still requires basic auth or OAuth, the user / client-ID and password / secret stored in the communication arrangement must match the ones held by the AP provider. A typo or a recently-rotated secret immediately causes 401.\n\n3. Endpoint URL changed by the provider  \n   \u2022 Some providers switch from \u201c/edi/receiving\u201d to \u201c/invoices/peppol/v1\u201d or move from test to production hostnames. The URL hard-coded in the communication arrangement no longer points to the protected resource for which your certificate is whitelisted; the AP therefore challenges you and returns 401.\n\nTroubleshooting and resolution checklist\na) Certificate path  \n   1. Run transaction STRUST and check validity dates of the certificate entered in view EDOC_PEPPOL_CRT (on-prem) or app \u201cMaintain Peppol Certificates\u201d (cloud).  \n   2. Compare thumbprint with the one your AP provider lists in its portal.  \n   3. If wrong/expired, import the new PKCS#12 file, assign it to the participant ID, and repeat the send test.\n\nb) HTTP credentials  \n   1. Open the communication arrangement (Communication System tab) and re-enter the user/password or OAuth client-ID/secret supplied by the AP provider.  \n   2. Press \u201cCheck Connection\u201d; status code must be 200.  \n   3. Activate the arrangement again and resend the document.\n\nc) Endpoint URL  \n   1. In the same arrangement verify the outbound service URL.  \n   2. Cross-check it with the latest onboarding guide or with the provider\u2019s portal.  \n   3.

SOA service name (table ED OINT) and Logical Port (table ED OSOASER)  \n   \u2022 The code selects ED OINT with the interface ID, then looks up ED OSOASER for a logical port valid for the company code.  \n   \u2022 If either entry is missing, the program raises error e055(edocument) or similar.\n\n3. AIF interface definition  \n   \u2022 Namespace (/AIF/NS), Interface name (/AIF/IFNAME) and Version (/AIF/IFVERSION) are unpacked from the Interface-ID.  \n   \u2022 The AIF interface (Outbound direction \u2018O\u2019) must be active, with a structure assigned in /AIF/CUST.\n\n4. Communication Arrangement (Key User extensibility app)  \n   \u2022 For Private Cloud the logical port created above is bound to a Communication Arrangement (for example SAP_COM_0469 \u201cElectronic Document Inbound Integration\u201d).  \n   \u2022 Inside the arrangement you supply:  \n     \u2013 Communication System (host, client certificate or user/password)  \n     \u2013 Communication User (technical user)  \n     \u2013 Inbound service URL that CPI / external system will call.\n\n5. Trust & Certificates  \n   \u2022 If certificates are used the root/intermediate certificates of the sender have to be imported in STRUST (PCC uses the \u201cSAP-OSS\u201d tenant-wide SSL PSE).\n\n6. Company-code specific activation  \n   \u2022 SSCUI 103060 \u201cActivate Document and Reporting Compliance\u201d \u2013 flag \u201cInbound\u201d for each company code.  \n   \u2022 SSCUI 103061 \u201cAssign Inbound Interface Variant\u201d \u2013 ties the company code to the interface-ID above.\n\n7. Optional mapping BAdIs  \n   \u2022 BAdIs such as EDOCUMENT_MX_FILL_TRANSPORT_V4 (see fill_carta_porte_v4 method) must be implemented if you need to enrich or map incoming payload to SAP fields.\n\n8. Business Catalog / Role  \n   \u2022 Business Catalog SAP_CA_BC_COM_EXT and SAP_FI_TAX_EDOC_PC must be assigned to the communication user so that the service can post data.\n\nMinimal step-by-step checklist\n\n1. Activate scope item 42K (or 5X8/2AZ depending on country) in CBC.  \n2. SSCUI 150001 \u2013 Define logical system for external sender.  \n3. SSCUI 103060 \u2013 Activate Document & Reporting Compliance (Inbound flag).  \n4. SSCUI 103061 \u2013 Maintain interface variant and AIF version.  \n5. Maintain EDOC_INTERFACE, ED OINT and ED OSOASER entries (done by content activation or manually in \u201cManage Electronic Document Settings\u201d).  \n6. Create Communication System + Communication User.  \n7. Create Communication Arrangement for scenario SAP_COM_0469 (or country-specific one).  \n   \u2013 Note inbound service URL and credentials \u2013 give them to CPI / your external platform.  \n8. (If CPI is used) Deploy the iFlow and point its receiver endpoint to the URL from step 7.  \n9. Implement/activate mapping BAdIs if country note tells you so.  \n10. Test with /AIF/IFMON or \u201cMonitor Electronic Documents \u2013 Inbound\u201d.\n\nPlain-language summary\nBefore SAP S/4HANA Private Cloud will accept a document sent from an external system you must: switch on the inbound part of Document & Reporting Compliance for your company code, create the interface and logical-port Customizing, and expose an SAP communication arrangement (with user or certificate) that the sender calls\u2014otherwise the ABAP code will reject the message.",

Why currencyID shows the plant code  \n   \u2022 During XML creation the Malaysian mapping classes (CL_EDOC_MAP_MY_*) build the element  \n\n        TaxTotal/TaxAmount @currencyID  \n        \u2192 field  ls_tax_total-tax_amount-base-base-currency_id  \n\n   \u2022 The value is copied straight from the billing / accounting document:\n\n        SD documents :  VBRK-WAERK  \n        FI documents :  BKPF-WAERS  \n        MM IV         :  RBKP-WAERS\n\n   \u2022 If WAERK/WAERS is initial the ABAP structure that is later serialised into XML is already one\n     position \u201cto the left\u201d; when it is flushed to XML the next field in memory \u2013 VBRK-WERKS /\n     RBKP-WERKS (the 4-character plant) \u2013 is read instead of the empty currency field.  \n     Result: currencyID = plant.\n\n   \u2022 Remedy  \n     a) Make sure every source document carries a currency (most Malaysian companies simply use\n        MYR). Correct / reverse & re-post billing or FI documents where WAERK / WAERS is blank.  \n     b) Apply the current support package or the individual correction instruction contained in\n        SAP Note 340 3257 (Document & Reporting Compliance MY \u2013 wrong currencyID in TaxTotal) \u2013\n        it adds an explicit \u201cIF currency is initial \u21d2 take company-code currency (T001-WAERS)\u201d\n        fallback to CL_EDOC_MAP_MY_*\u2192FILL_TAX_TOTAL.\n\n2. Error CF366 \u201cTax exemption reason is required\u201d  \n   \u2022 Whenever TaxCategory/@id = \u2018E\u2019 the Malaysian mapping looks for a\n     tax-exemption reason at two places (see CL_EDOC_MAP_MY_*\u2192FILL_TAX_TOTAL):\n\n         \u2013 First text line (TDLINE) of a long text that belongs to the\n           billing item    (object = VBBP, text id = \u20180001\u2019)       \u2013 SD side  \n           or\n           PO item        (object = EKPO, text id = \u2018F01\u2019)         \u2013 MM/FI side\n         \u2013 If no text is found it checks the multiple-value mapping \u201cTAX_EXEMPTION\u201d.\n\n     Absence of both triggers message CF366.\n\n   \u2022 What to do  \n     a) Maintain the long text that contains the legal reason for exemption.  \n        \u2013 SD: VF02/VF03 \u2192 item \u2192 Texts \u2192 create text with ID 0001.  \n        \u2013 MM/FI: ME22N / MIR4 \u2192 item \u2192 Texts \u2192 create text with ID F01.  \n     b) (or) Maintain the mapping table EDOC_MAP_MVAL (view EDOC_MVAL_V) entry  \n        \u2018TAX_EXEMPTION\u2019:   INT-VALUE = Tax Code, EXT-VALUE1 = Reason Code,\n        EXT-VALUE2 = Reason Description.  \n     c) Re-process the eDocument in EDOC_COCKPIT.\n\nQuick checklist for your document 51000002962024\n\n\u2022 In VF03 check header currency (VBRK-WAERK). If empty, cancel and re-bill after entering MYR.  \n\u2022 Open any billing item with tax code that leads to \u201cE\u201d in XML.  \n  \u2013 If exempt: maintain the text (ID 0001) with the reason.  \n\u2022 Run EDOC_COCKPIT \u2192 \u201cRebuild XML\u201d \u2192 \u201cSubmit\u201d. The XML will now contain  \n     <TaxAmount currencyID=\"MYR\"> \u2026 </TaxAmount>  \n  and message CF366 disappears.\n\nPlain-language summary  \nThe XML shows the plant instead of the currency because the sales / FI document was saved without a currency; fixing the document (or applying the SAP Note that falls back to company-code currency) cures the XML.  \nThe CF366 error means an exempt tax line is missing its legal reason; add the reason as a text on the billing/PO item or maintain it in the value-mapping table, then resubmit.",

    "generated_answer": "Below is a field-proven checklist you can follow when you have to build a brand-new electronic-document process (invoice, payment report, etc.) in the SAP Electronic Document Processing (EDP) framework on SAP S/4HANA Cloud, public edition.\n\n1. Analyse & scope  \n   \u2022 Confirm that the legal requirement is not already covered by SAP Document and Reporting Compliance (DRC) content.  \n   \u2022 Identify: source business object (e.g. Accounting Invoice), target authority and format (Peppol BIS 3.0, UBL, local JSON, etc.), submission channel (API, AS4, SFTP, e-mail).  \n   \u2022 Collect validation rules published by the authority.\n\n2. Prepare your development tenant  \n   \u2022 Get a 3-system landscape (DEV/Q/PRD) and enable \u201cElectronic Document Processing\u201d (scope item 5XU) via SAP Central Business Configuration (CBC).  \n   \u2022 Assign yourself the EDP authorisation role (SAP_BR_EDOC_PROC_CONF).\n\n3. Create the new Process Definition in the EDP Cockpit (BTP)  \n   \u2022 Open \u201cManage Electronic Document Processes\u201d app.  \n   \u2022 \u201cAdd Process\u201d \u2192 give a key (e.g. \u201cMYCOMPANY_PEPPOL_INV\u201d) and select the business document type (CustomerInvoice, SupplierInvoice, etc.).  \n   \u2022 Decide whether the process runs \u201csynchronously\u201d (called at save/post) or \u201casynchronously\u201d (picked up by scheduler).\n\n4. Define Data Acquisition (= source payload)  \n   \u2022 Re-use an SAP released CDS view if it already exposes everything you need (e.g. I_BillingDocumentEDP).  \n   \u2022 If gaps exist, extend the view using custom CDS View app or create a RAP projection view and mark it \u201cEDP-releasable\u201d.  \n   \u2022 Map semantic fields to your EDP Process in the \u201cAssign Data Source\u201d step.\n\n5. Model Mapping & Transformation  \n   \u2022 Launch the \u201cMapping Designer\u201d (part of EDP) from the Process.  \n   \u2022 Upload the target XSD/JSON schema from the authority.  \n   \u2022 Drag-and-drop field mappings; add functions (date \u2192 string, conditional nodes, etc.).  \n   \u2022 Persist the mapping version; activate it.\n\n6. Add Validation & Enrichment rules (optional but typical)  \n   \u2022 In the same designer, create rule sets (e.g. \u201cInvoice total = Sum of line totals\u201d).  \n   \u2022 Choose whether a rule is an \u201cerror\u201d (blocks posting), \u201cwarning\u201d, or \u201cinformation\u201d.\n\n7. Configure Routing / Submission Adapter  \n   \u2022 Go to the \u201cConnectivity\u201d tab of the Process.  \n   \u2022 Pick an existing adapter (Peppol AS4, SFTP, REST, SOAP) or create a new adapter if the protocol is new.  \n   \u2022 Maintain endpoint, certificate, credentials (these are stored in BTP Secrets).\n\n8. Expose the Process to S/4HANA Cloud  \n   \u2022 In S/4HC, open \u201cCommunication Arrangements\u201d and create a new arrangement for scenario SAP_COM_0779 (EDP).  \n   \u2022 Point it to your BTP subaccount and process key.  \n   \u2022 Activate Output Control or Business Event Subscription so that the business document triggers your EDP Process.\n\n9. Test in Quality system  \n   \u2022 Post a test invoice \u2192 check \u201cMonitor Electronic Documents\u201d app.  \n   \u2022 Verify: Status flows through \u201cNew \u2192 In Process \u2192 Submitted \u2192 Accepted\u201d.  \n   \u2022 Download the generated XML/JSON; validate with the authority\u2019s online validator.\n\n10. Transport to Production  \n   \u2022 Use \u201cSoftware Collections\u201d transport in CBC to move: CDS view extension, custom communication arrangement, and EDP Process artefacts.  \n   \u2022 Re-enter production-only secrets (certificates, passwords) in the adapter configuration.\n\n11. Operate & monitor  \n   \u2022 Business users handle rejections in \u201cMonitor Electronic Documents\u201d; they can restart or correct master data.  \n   \u2022 Technical team monitors message flow in SAP BTP (Message Queue, CPI if used).  \n   \u2022 Apply hotfixes via new Process versions; activate without downtime.\n\nPlain-language takeaway: In SAP S/4HANA Cloud, you build a new electronic document flow by (1) defining a process in the EDP cockpit, (2) linking it to a CDS view for data, (3) mapping and validating it to the required XML/JSON, (4) connecting an adapter for submission, and (5) exposing it to S/4HANA through a communication arrangement\u2014then test, transport, and monitor.",

    "agent_judge_reasoning": "The generated answer is fully helpful and accurately addresses the question about extending an Action in eDocument Cockpit for a custom developed Process in Private Cloud. Here's why:\n\n1. Accuracy: The answer correctly states that it is possible to extend actions in the eDocument Cockpit for custom-developed processes in SAP Private Cloud. This aligns with both the expert answer and the additional context provided by the sap_documentation_summary tool.\n\n2. Comprehensive explanation: The generated answer provides a detailed technical explanation of how the extension works, including the relevant classes (CL_EDC_ACTION), methods (perform_ui_action), and tables (EDOACTION, EDOACTWEBUIMETHV) involved in the process. This level of detail goes beyond the expert answer and demonstrates a deep understanding of the underlying mechanism.\n\n3. Step-by-step guide: The answer includes a clear, step-by-step guide on how to implement the extension in S/4HANA Cloud, private edition. This practical information is highly valuable for users looking to implement such an extension.\n\n4. Limitations and constraints: The answer also mentions important limitations, such as the inability to overwrite SAP-delivered actions for standard processes and the fact that this approach is specific to Private-Cloud or on-premise systems. This information helps set appropriate expectations for users.\n\n5. Code example: The inclusion of a short code example (zcl_edc_act_zsend_log) and table entries provides concrete guidance for implementation, which is not present in the expert answer.\n\n6. Alignment with additional context: While the generated answer doesn't mention Business Add-Ins (BAdIs) specifically, as discussed in the sap_documentation_summary output, it does cover the core concept of extending functionality through customization and adding new actions, which is consistent with the BAdI approach.\n\nIn conclusion, the generated answer not only fully addresses the question but also provides more comprehensive and practical information than the expert answer, making it exceptionally helpful for users looking to extend actions in the eDocument Cockpit for custom processes in SAP Private Cloud.",

    "generated_answer": "Technical explanation  \n\u2022 At runtime the Cockpit framework (class CL_EDC_ACTION) reads the table EDOACTION to decide which \u201cAction\u201d belongs to a process, and then calls method perform_ui_action.  \n\u2022 perform_ui_action looks up view EDOACTWEBUIMETHV, instantiates the UI class entered there and dynamically calls the method that implements the action:\n\n```\nmo_edc_consistency_config_db->select_edcactionuimeth( \u2026 ).\nCREATE OBJECT lo_action_ui TYPE (ls_edcactionuimeth-ui_class).\nCALL METHOD lo_action_ui->(ls_edcactionuimeth-ui_method) \u2026\n```\n\n\u2022 Because both EDOACTION* and EDOACTWEBUIMETH* are pure Customizing tables (and not SAP-controlled configuration), you can add your own entries without modifying SAP code.  \n\u2022 Nothing in the framework checks the software-component of the implementing class, therefore a Z-class that you create in a Private-Cloud system is executed exactly like an SAP class.  \n\nWhat you can do in S/4HANA Cloud, private edition  \n1. Create (or copy) your own process in view EDOPROCESSV / EDOPROCESST.  \n2. Add the extra action in view EDOACTION and assign it to your process in view EDOACTIONPROC.  \n   \u2013 Give the action an \u201caction type\u201d (e.g. COMMUNICATE, DOWNLOAD, CUSTOM).  \n3. Create an ABAP class (e.g. ZCL_EDC_ACT_<XXX>) that implements the UI logic; the class can inherit from CL_EDC_ACTION_UI or be a plain class with a public method.  \n4. Maintain view EDOACTWEBUIMETHV: enter your action-variant, the class name and the public method to be called.  \n5. (Optional) If the action must call the interface connector, add a line in EDOINTFSTEP so that standard communication handling can be reused.  \n6. Transport the customizing to PCE quality & production tenants\u2014no modification key is required.\n\nLimitations / things you cannot do  \n\u2022 You cannot overwrite or change an SAP-delivered action of a standard process; you can only add new actions or create your own process.  \n\u2022 In public-cloud tenants the same tables are read-only, so the approach is not possible there\u2014this is specific to Private-Cloud or on-prem systems.  \n\u2022 User-role authorizations (PFCG object /FPM/ACT) still have to be adapted so that the new action button is visible.\n\nShort example  \nCustom process ZPROC with action ZSEND_LOG to write an additional log file.\n\n1. Z class:\n\n```\nCLASS zcl_edc_act_zsend_log DEFINITION PUBLIC.\n  PUBLIC SECTION.\n    METHODS execute\n        IMPORTING it_result_guid TYPE edc_con_obj_res_tab\n                  iv_set_ral     TYPE abap_bool\n                  id_data        TYPE REF TO data\n        CHANGING  ct_log         TYPE edc_t_message.\nENDCLASS.\n```\n\n2. Table entries  \n   \u2022 EDOACTION:  ZSEND_LOG  | CUST | \u201cSend log to DMS\u201d  \n   \u2022 EDOACTIONPROC:  ZPROC \u2013 ZSEND_LOG  \n   \u2022 EDOACTWEBUIMETHV:  ZSEND_LOG | <blank variant> | ZCL_EDC_ACT_ZSEND_LOG | EXECUTE\n\nResult: the cockpit shows a new button; pressing it triggers your Z-class, while the rest of the Cockpit framework\u2014selection, message handling, locking\u2014stays intact.\n\nPlain-language answer  \nYes\u2014because the Cockpit reads its action list from Customizing tables, you can add your own action for a custom process in an S/4HANA Private-Cloud system; simply enter the new action in EDOACTION*, point it to your own ABAP class/method, and it will run like any SAP-delivered action.",
