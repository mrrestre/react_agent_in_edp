    "answer": "To attach additional files to the standard XML in Public Cloud, you can use the Business Add-In (BAdI) EDOC_ADAPTOR_CLOUD and enhance the XML file generated for an electronic document.\nBy enhancing the XML file, you can include additional information that may be relevant for your business processes .\nTo implement this enhancement, you can follow these steps in ABAP Development Tools (ADT):\n1. In your ABAP project, go to the enhancement spot ES_EDOCUMENT_CLOUD and select 'New BAdI Enhancement Implementation'.\n2. Enter a package, name, and description for the implementation.\n3. Choose 'Add BAdI Implementation' and select EDOC_ADAPTOR_CLOUD .\n4. (Optional) Create a BAdI filter for Country and/or Generic Filter.\n5. Choose 'Implementing Class' to create a new implementation class.\n6. Activate your BAdI implementation .\nOnce you have implemented the BAdI, you can fill the XML tag <BuyersItemIdentification> with the desired additional information.\nThis can be done by reading the relevant data from the source documents and filling the appropriate XML tags.\nPlease note that the specific implementation details may vary depending on your system setup and requirements.\nIt is recommended to refer to the provided sources for more detailed instructions and examples.",

    "generated_answer": "Short answer  \nNo \u2013 in SAP S/4HANA Cloud, public edition (formerly \u201cPublic Cloud\u201d) you cannot create your own variant of the Spanish customer-invoice eDocument process or enhance the standard \u201cactions\u201d of that process.  In the public cloud SAP only allows a very small, field-level enrichment via the released Spain-specific BAdIs; any deeper change (new XML structure, new submission step, additional middleware call, extra validation, etc.) is currently outside the scope of supported extensibility.\n\nWhat is possible (field-level enrichment only)  \nThrough the Fiori app \u201cCustom Logic\u201d you can implement the released BAdIs shown below.  They run while the standard XML is being generated and let you overwrite single elements:\n\n\u2022 Spain: Filling of Bank Account Data \u2013 supply IBAN (<IBAN>)  \n\u2022 Spain: Filling of Delivery Note Field \u2013 decide what goes into <DeliveryNote>  \n\u2022 Spain: Filling of Discounts and Charges Reason \u2013 change \u201cMotivoDescRecar\u201d codes  \n\u2022 Spain: Determine Reason Code \u2013 set correction reason for credit memos  \n\u2022 Spain: Fill Partner Reference Fields \u2013 adjust contract / transaction numbers for public entities\n\n(Sources: SAP Help \u201cApp Extensibility: Manage Electronic Documents (Spain)\u201d and BAdI list \u2013 see tool outputs [sap_documentation_summary #1] and [sap_help_lookup #1].)\n\nWhat is NOT possible in Public Cloud  \n\u2022 Enhancing the eDocument \u201cAction\u201d step with your own business logic  \n\u2022 Adding new mapping proxies or changing the standard XML beyond the BAdI fields  \n\u2022 Plugging in a different integration flow (custom middleware, third-party PEPPOL provider, etc.)  \n\u2022 Sending invoices that originate outside S/4HANA into the SAP eDocument framework\n\nThese restrictions are stated in the Document & Reporting Compliance Extensibility FAQ (\u201cEnhancement of eDocument Action with custom-defined business logic is not supported in Public Cloud\u201d; \u201csending documents from external systems not supported\u201d) \u2013 see tool output [sap_documentation_summary #2].\n\nTherefore  \nAs a Spanish Public-Cloud customer you can only use the BAdIs above to fine-tune individual XML fields.

Key-user (in-app) extensibility alone is not sufficient to change the behaviour of the standard Italian customer-invoice (Fattura PA) process; you must create ABAP Cloud code in the 3-system developer tenant and use the released enhancement BAdIs delivered for DRC.\n\nWhat you can do  \n\u2022 Add or populate extra XML tags  \n  \u2013 Implement BAdI EDOC_MAP_HEADER / EDOC_MAP_ITEM to enrich the standard mapping before the XML is built.  \n  \u2013 Custom fields created in \u201cCustom Fields & Logic\u201d (business context : Finance \u2013 Electronic Document) are automatically appended to the eDocument extension table and can be moved into the XML in the same BAdIs.  \n\n\u2022 Suppress / force eDocument creation for certain billing documents  \n  \u2013 BAdI EDOC_ADAPTOR_CLOUD lets you decide, at runtime, whether an eDocument is created from an SD or FI source document.  \n\n\u2022 Perform additional checks or set a custom cockpit status  \n  \u2013 BAdI EDOC_STATUS_UPD allows you to influence the status life-cycle shown in the eDocument Cockpit.  \n\nWhat you cannot do (current Public-Cloud restrictions)  \n\u2717 Modify or replace the \u201cActions\u201d (Send, Cancel, etc.) offered in the cockpit.  \n\u2717 Plug a non-SAP communication layer or send eDocuments that were created in external systems.  \n\u2717 Integrate modules that SAP has not yet enabled for the Italian solution (e.g. Convergent Invoicing, RE-FX).\n\nPrerequisites  \n\u2022 Licensed SAP Document and Reporting Compliance for Italy.  \n\u2022 SAP Integration Suite tenant (or the pre-delivered SAP Peppol Access Point) already configured.  \n\u2022 Developer Extensibility activated in your Q-system; development is done with ABAP Development Tools (ADT) and transported via software collections.\n\nImplementation outline  \n1.

Use app \u201cCustom Fields & Logic\u201d to add any new business fields to context I_EDOCUMENT.  \n3. In ADT create an implementation of BAdI EDOC_MAP_HEADER (for header-level tags) or EDOC_MAP_ITEM (for line-level tags). Populate the exporting structure EDOCUMENT_OUT accordingly.  \n4. (Optional) Implement BAdI EDOC_ADAPTOR_CLOUD if you need document-type filtering.  \n5.

    "agent_judge_reasoning": "The generated answer is fully helpful and accurately addresses the question about extending an Action in the eDocument Cockpit for a custom-developed process in Private Cloud. Here's why:\n\n1. Accuracy: The answer correctly states that it is possible to extend actions in the eDocument Cockpit for custom processes in SAP S/4HANA Private Cloud. This aligns with both the expert answer and the additional context provided by the tool.\n\n2. Comprehensiveness: The generated answer goes beyond the expert answer by providing a detailed, step-by-step guide on how to implement the extension. It covers all aspects from creating a custom process to registering the new action, assigning runtime logic, exposing the button in the cockpit, and controlling when the button is enabled.\n\n3. Technical depth: The answer includes specific technical details such as table names (e.g., EDOC_PRC_ACT, EDOC_PRC_ACT2ST), transaction codes (EDOC_COCKPIT), and interface names (IF_EDOC_PROCESS_STEP). This level of detail demonstrates a thorough understanding of the SAP system architecture.\n\n4. Consistency with SAP documentation: The answer mentions that the information has been validated against SAP Help and framework source code, which adds credibility to the response.\n\n5. Extensibility considerations: The answer addresses the specific context of Private Cloud, noting that \"In Private Cloud you have the same ABAP extensibility as on-premise, but code must stay within the released API set.\"\n\n6. Additional insights: The answer provides valuable information about limitations and key points to consider, such as not being able to change SAP-delivered actions directly and the need for proper authorization handling.\n\nWhile the tool-provided context mentions some different aspects like Business Add-Ins (BAdIs) and the Application Interface Framework (AIF) for logging, these are not contradictory to the generated answer but rather complementary. The generated answer focuses more on the direct configuration and implementation of custom actions, which is precisely what the question asked for.\n\nIn conclusion, the generated answer is fully helpful as it provides a comprehensive, accurate, and technically detailed response to the user's question, going beyond the expert answer in terms of actionable guidance.",

    "generated_answer": "Short answer  \nYes\u2014you can add your own \u201cAction\u201d button (or change the logic behind an existing one) for a customer-built eDocument process in an SAP S/4HANA Private-Cloud system. The cockpit reads its toolbar directly from customizing; therefore, as soon as your action is defined in the \u201cManage eDocument Process\u201d configuration and the corresponding ABAP step logic exists, the button appears automatically in both the SAP GUI cockpit (EDOC_COCKPIT) and the Fiori app \u201cManage Electronic Documents\u201d.\n\nDetails and how-to (validated against SAP Help and framework source code)  \n\n1. Copy or create a customer process  \n   \u2022 App/Tx: \u201cManage eDocument Process\u201d (Fiori ID F5580) or SPRO \u2192 \u2026 \u2192 Document Compliance \u2192 Framework \u2192 Define eDocument Process  \n   \u2022 Copy an existing process (e.g. MX_CFDI) or start a new Z* process so you stay in the customer namespace.\n\n2. Register the new Action  \n   Node: \u201cActions incl. Variants for a Process\u201d (table EDOC_PRC_ACT)  \n   \u2013 eDoc Action: a 20-char key such as `ZAPPROVE`  \n   \u2013 Variant: leave blank unless you need several variants of the same key.\n\n3. Assign the runtime logic  \n   Node: \u201cProcess Steps Executed by an Action\u201d (EDOC_PRC_ACT2ST)  \n   \u2013 Add one or more steps in the desired sequence (010, 020 \u2026).  \n   \u2013 Each step points to an ABAP class that implements the interface IF_EDOC_PROCESS_STEP (generated when you create a step in the same app).  \n   \u2013 In Private Cloud you can code that class with ADT; no modification key is required because it is created in the customer namespace.\n\n4. Expose the button in the cockpit  \n   Node: \u201cProcess Toolbar Function Assignment\u201d (EDOC_PRC_GUI)  \n   \u2013 Function = your Action key (`ZAPPROVE`)  \n   \u2013 Function type = \u201cButton\u201d or \u201cMenu Item\u201d  \n   \u2013 Position = numeric order in the toolbar group.\n\n5. Control when the button is enabled (optional)  \n   \u2022 \u201cStatus Flag Check\u201d \u2013 patterns of status flags that must be true before the user can press the button.  \n   \u2022 \u201cStatus Flag Change\u201d \u2013 which flags are set after the action finishes.  \n   \u2022 Maintain \u201cProcess Status Determination\u201d if you introduce a new overall status.\n\n6. Transport and test  \n   \u2022 All entries are customizing and belong to a transport request.  \n   \u2022 Run EDOC_COCKPIT or Fiori \u201cManage Electronic Documents\u201d; your new button appears automatically when the status-check pattern is fulfilled.  \n   \u2022 To execute the action in background, use job template \u201ceDocument (General): Process Actions in the Background\u201d (program EDOCUMENT_BG_ACTION) with your action key.\n\nKey points / limitations  \n\n\u2022 You cannot change SAP-delivered actions in place; instead, copy the standard process and adjust it or create a Z-action.  \n\u2022 In Private Cloud you have the same ABAP extensibility as on-premise, but code must stay within the released API set; implementing IF_EDOC_PROCESS_STEP is allowed.  \n\u2022 The cockpit UI itself does not need to be extended\u2014buttons are rendered dynamically from the configuration table view EDOC_PRC_GUI (see class CL_EDOC_DCC_UTILITY \u2192 method GET_PROCESS_ACTION in the framework source).  \n\u2022 Authorizations: the standard roles (e.g. SAP_BR_EDOC_PROCESSOR) allow execution if the action is in the process definition; create a copy if you need a separate authorization object.  \n\u2022 Public-Cloud Key-User tools (Custom Fields/Logic) are not required unless you additionally want to show new document fields on the list; that part can also be done in Private Cloud but is optional for the action itself.\n\nTherefore: extending or adding an action for a custom eDocument process is fully supported in SAP S/4HANA Private Cloud; the cockpit will pick it up automatically once you maintain the entries described above and provide the accompanying ABAP process-step implementation.",

Create the field  \n   \u2022 Fiori app \u201cCustom Fields\u201d (App ID F1481)  \n   \u2022 Business context : Document Compliance  \n   \u2022 Define label, identifier, data type \u2192 Publish  \n   Result: the field is appended to CDS view I_EDOCUMENT_EXT and becomes technically available.\n\n2.

Fill the field automatically  \n   In the same app choose \u201cLogic\u201d \u2192 \u201cCreate BAdI Implementation\u201d for the post-assembly BAdI (name varies per release, e.g. EDO_E_DOCUMENT_HEADER_MOD).  \n   Copy the organisational attribute (plant, sales org, company code, \u2026) from the billing or FI document into your new field.\n\n3.

    "generated_answer": "Yes.  \nIn SAP S/4HANA Cloud, public edition (Germany), the generation of an eDocument is not hard-wired; you can suppress it whenever your own business criteria are met.\n\nHow you do it\n\n1. Implement the cloud BAdI \u201cEnhancements for the Processing of eDocuments\u201d  \n   Technical name : EDOC_ADAPTOR_CLOUD (SAP Help lookup result).  \n   \u2022 Create the implementation in ADT (Eclipse) by providing filter value COUNTRY = \u2018DE\u2019.  \n   \u2022 Implement method IF_EDOC_ADAPTOR_CLOUD~IS_RELEVANT.  \n     \u2013 Import structures contain the billing / FI-document header & item data.  \n     \u2013 Set the exporting flag EV_IS_RELEVANT = abap_false when your condition (e.g. net value = 0, internal customer, test plant etc.) is fulfilled.\n\n2. Activate the class; transport it with the normal Cloud software-collection process.\n\nEffect in the Fiori apps\n\n\u2022 Manage Electronic Documents and eDocument Cockpit call the same framework.  \n\u2022 When IS_RELEVANT returns abap_false, the source document is simply not handed over to the framework, therefore  \n  \u2013 no eDocument record is created,  \n  \u2013 the invoice will not appear under \u201cNot Yet Created\u201d in the Cockpit, and  \n  \u2013 users cannot create it manually from those apps either.\n\nBoundary conditions\n\n\u2022 The BAdI influences only documents created after your implementation is active. Existing eDocuments have to be cancelled/deleted in the Cockpit if they are no longer required.  \n\u2022 No configuration activity in SPRO or SSC-UI is necessary; the logic is 100 % in the BAdI.  \n\u2022 This capability is available to public-cloud customers; it requires Developer Extensibility (embedded ABAP) rather than the key-user \u201cCustom Logic\u201d app.\n\nTool evidence used\n\n\u2022 sap_documentation_summary \u2013 confirms that EDOC_ADAPTOR_CLOUD \u2192 IS_RELEVANT is the SAP-recommended way to \u201cdecide whether an electronic document should be created\u201d.  \n\u2022 sap_help_lookup \u2013 lists the same BAdI, its scope, method signature and cloud implementation steps, independently validating the approach.\n\nTherefore: As a German S/4HANA Cloud public customer you can indeed restrict (or completely block) eDocument creation in both the Manage Electronic Documents and eDocument Cockpit apps by coding your own relevance logic in BAdI EDOC_ADAPTOR_CLOUD.",

Here's why it's fully helpful:\n\n1. Correct Implementation: The provided code correctly implements the IS_RELEVANT method of the IF_EDOC_ADAPTOR_CLOUD interface, which is part of the EDCO_CLOUD_ADAPTOR BAdI.\n\n2. Relevant Conditions: The sample includes three relevant conditions for controlling eDocument creation: checking for zero invoice net value, company code blacklist, and business partner type. These are practical and useful examples.\n\n3. Proper Use of SAP Cloud ABAP: The code uses only released ABAP-for-Cloud artifacts, which is crucial for cloud implementations.\n\n4. Alignment with SAP Standards: The answer mentions that the coding pattern follows SAP's own implementation (CL_EDOC_ADAPTOR_MX_SD_FICA), which ensures consistency with SAP standards.\n\n5. Deployment Instructions: The answer provides clear steps on how to deploy the implementation in SAP S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition using the Custom Logic app.\n\n6. Best Practices: The answer includes important points to remember, such as respecting the incoming flag, avoiding direct SELECT statements, and keeping the logic lightweight.\n\n7. Additional Information: The answer mentions other methods available in the same BAdI for further customization if needed.\n\nThe generated answer not only meets the requirements of the question but also provides additional valuable information and best practices, making it fully helpful for implementing the IS_RELEVANT method in a cloud environment.",

It aligns well with the information provided by the sap_documentation_summary tool and expands on the expert answer with more detailed implementation steps. Here's why it's fully helpful:\n\n1. It correctly identifies the main method for enhancing XML in the public cloud: using Business Add-Ins (BAdIs), specifically the \"Cloud EDOC Adaptor BAdI: Modify Final Invoice XML\".\n\n2. It provides a step-by-step guide for implementing the enhancement, including:\n   - Using the Custom Logic app (F1481) to create a new implementation\n   - Coding the XML post-processing logic\n   - Activating and testing the enhancement\n\n3. It offers an example code snippet demonstrating how to modify XML nodes and perform validations.\n\n4. It mentions additional relevant BAdIs for Greece-specific scenarios, which aligns with the tool's output about using BAdIs for custom logic.\n\n5. The answer includes information about testing, correcting, and resubmitting documents, which is crucial for the implementation process.\n\n6. It provides context about the limitations of public cloud customizations, explaining that you cannot modify the delivered XSLT/AIF mapping directly.\n\n7. The answer goes beyond the expert answer by including information about related configuration paths and other Greece-specific BAdIs that may be useful.\n\nWhile the expert answer focuses on implementation steps in ABAP Development Tools (ADT), the generated answer correctly adapts this for the public cloud environment where direct ABAP development is not possible.

Identify the correct BAdI  \n   \u2022 App: Custom Logic (F1481)  \n   \u2022 Business Context: eDocument: Greece  \n   \u2022 BAdI name (most frequently used for XML changes):  \n     \u201cCloud EDOC Adaptor BAdI: Modify Final Invoice XML\u201d  \n   (Other Greece-specific BAdIs exist for tax type, VAT classification, etc. Use them only if you need to influence business logic rather than pure XML.)  \n\n2. Create an enhancement implementation  \n   a. In Custom Logic choose \u201c+ New\u201d.  \n   b. Enter a name/description, keep \u201cImplementation Type = In-App Extensibility (ABAP for Cloud)\u201d.  \n   c. Save and press \u201cGo to Editor\u201d.\n\n3.

Activate and transport (if two-system landscape). The activation is immediate; no extra configuration step is needed.\n\n5. Test the enhancement  \n   \u2022 Post a billing/FI document \u25ba an eDocument is generated.  \n   \u2022 In Manage Electronic Documents / eDocument Cockpit (F1587) open the row and view the XML preview.  \n   \u2022 If your validation raises an error, status becomes \u201cError During Mapping\u201d; click \u201cDisplay Log\u201d to read ct_return messages.\n\n6.

Prepare the landscape\n---------------------------------------------------\n\u2022 System type: 3-system landscape (DEV/QAS/PRD) \u2013 Developer Extensibility is enabled only here.  \n\u2022 Authorizations: assign the role collections \u201cDocument Compliance Framework Development\u201d, \u201cManage eDocument Process\u201d, \u201cManage Electronic Documents\u201d, etc.  \n\u2022 Technical services: be sure that SAP Document & Reporting Compliance (DRC) and SAP Integration Suite (for message exchange) are licensed and set up.\n\n---------------------------------------------------\n2. Create the empty process shell in the Fiori app\n   \u201cManage eDocument Process\u201d\n---------------------------------------------------\na.

Maintain Process-Specific Statuses  \n   \u2013 Define your own business statuses (e.g. CREATED, SEND_REQUESTED, SENT_TO_IFLOW, ACK_OK, ERROR).  \n   \u2013 Map every status to one of the five framework meta-statuses (Created, In-Process, Completed, Error, Cancelled).  \nc. Maintain Actions  \n   \u2022 Typical actions you add:  \n     \u2013 CREATE_FROM_HOOK\u2003(framework calls this itself)  \n     \u2013 SUBMIT\u2003(outbound to integration flow / tax authority)  \n     \u2013 GET_STATUS\u2003(poll external system)  \n     \u2013 RESUBMIT\u2003(optional retry)  \n     \u2013 CANCEL / DELETE  \n   \u2022 For each action assign:  \n     \u2013 allowed current statuses  \n     \u2013 next status (on success)  \n     \u2013 error status (on failure)  \n     \u2013 execution type (manual or background)  \n     \u2013 required user role  \nd.

The generated answer uses a different BAdI (EDOCUMENT_OUTPUT or country-specific BAdI) compared to the expert answer (ZCL_BADI_EDOC_CHANGE_EMAIL_V2).

This is helpful for understanding the overall process.\n\n3. The generated answer includes error handling and size limit considerations, which are not present in the expert answer but are valuable additions.\n\n4. The expert answer uses a different approach to convert the PDF content to the required format (using SOLIX_TAB), while the generated answer uses cl_document_bcs=>xstring_to_solix(). Both approaches are valid, but they differ in implementation.\n\n5. The generated answer doesn't include the specific interface implementations (IF_BADI_INTERFACE, IF_EDOC_CLOUD_DATATYPES, IF_EDOC_CHANGE_EMAIL_V2) that are present in the expert answer.\n\n6.

Minimal coding template\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n```abap\nMETHOD if_edocument_badi~set_email_attachments.\n\n*---(1) keep what SAP already creates\n  super->set_email_attachments(\n      EXPORTING iv_attachm_type = 'XML'          \"or whatever you need\n      IMPORTING et_attachment   = ct_email_attachments ).\n\n*-----------------------------------------------------------------\n*  (2) Build your own PDF (here: take it from spool and convert)\n*-----------------------------------------------------------------\n  DATA : lv_spoolid     TYPE rspoid,\n         lv_pdf_xstring TYPE xstring,\n         lt_pdf_solix   TYPE solix_tab.\n\n  \"Example only \u2013 pick the spool of the billing document form\n  lv_spoolid = <determine_spool_id_here>.        \"your logic\n  CALL FUNCTION 'CONVERT_OTFSPOOLJOB_2_PDF'\n       EXPORTING\n         src_spoolid              = lv_spoolid\n       IMPORTING\n         pdf                       = lv_pdf_xstring\n       EXCEPTIONS\n         others                    = 4.\n  IF sy-subrc <> 0 OR lv_pdf_xstring IS INITIAL.\n    RETURN.          \"nothing to add\n  ENDIF.\n\n  lt_pdf_solix = cl_document_bcs=>xstring_to_solix( lv_pdf_xstring ).\n\n*-----------------------------------------------------------------\n*  (3) Append one more line in the attachment table\n*-----------------------------------------------------------------\n  DATA ls_attach LIKE LINE OF ct_email_attachments.\n\n  ls_attach-attachm_subject = |Additional_Info_{ sy-datum }.pdf|.\n  ls_attach-attachm_type    = 'PDF'.             \"mandatory\n  ls_attach-content_hex     = lt_pdf_solix.\n  ls_attach-attachm_size    = xstrlen( lv_pdf_xstring ).\n\n  APPEND ls_attach TO ct_email_attachments.\n\nENDMETHOD.\n```\n\nImportant fields in the attachment line (structure EDOC_EMAIL_ATTACHMENT)  \n\u2022 ATTACHM_SUBJECT \u2013 the file name that the customer will see  \n\u2022 ATTACHM_TYPE     \u2013 must be \u2018PDF\u2019 for CL_BCS to set the correct MIME type  \n\u2022 CONTENT_HEX      \u2013 SOLIX_TAB (binary) content  \n\u2022 ATTACHM_SIZE     \u2013 `xstrlen( xstring )`\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n3.  What happens afterwards\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nWhen the eDocument framework (or Output Control) executes the send step it takes `CT_EMAIL_ATTACHMENTS`, feeds each line into CL_BCS:\n\n```abap\nlo_send_request->add_attachment(\n       i_attachment_type    = ls_attach-attachm_type   \"-> 'PDF'\n       i_attachment_subject = ls_attach-attachm_subject\n       i_att_content_hex    = ls_attach-content_hex ).\n```\n\nBecause your additional line is now present, the e-mail that is created contains the extra PDF in addition to the standard XML / original PDF that SAP already adds.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n4.  Checklist / pitfalls\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\u2022 Size limit: keep the cumulative size under the constant that SAP uses (see CL_EDOC_MAP_FR_B2B\u2192CHECK_ATTACHMENTS, default 10 MB).  \n\u2022 Duplicate file names: give your own PDF a unique `ATTACHM_SUBJECT`, otherwise some mail clients show only the last file with the same name.  \n\u2022 If Output Control is configured with \u201cMerge = X\u201d, SAP will already merge all PDFs into one; in that case attach your PDF only if you want it as a separate file.\n\nWith the above enhancement method you keep the standard behaviour untouched and simply enrich the mail package with any additional PDF that you produce at runtime.",

Initial BTP onboarding for DRC-CE  \n   \u2022 Subscribe to the \u201cSAP Document and Reporting Compliance, cloud edition\u201d service in an SAP BTP sub-account.  \n   \u2022 Run the booster \u201cSet Up an Account for SAP Document and Reporting Compliance, Cloud Edition\u201d (creates service instances, service key, role collections, destination).\n\n2. Activate the country/region-specific processes you plan to use  \n   \u2022 In the DRC-CE cockpit (BTP UI) open Settings \u2192 Processes and switch on each required process (e.g. Peppol, RO eFactura, SK IS EFA, Statutory Reporting, \u2026).\n\n3. Provide a signed SSL client certificate for S/4HANA Cloud  \n   \u2022 The certificate is imported into the S/4HANA Cloud system and is referenced later in the communication system.  \n   \u2022 If you do not yet have a signed certificate you must create and sign one before you continue.\n\n4. Create a service binding in BTP that exposes the client credentials  \n   \u2022 The binding ties the certificate to your DRC-CE service instance and makes the endpoint URL and OAuth2 details available for the business system.\n\n5. Build the communication setup in S/4HANA Cloud (public)  \n   \u2022 Communication User (technical user)  \n   \u2022 Communication System pointing to the DRC-CE URL (uses the SSL certificate or OAuth2 credentials from the service binding)  \n   \u2022 Communication Arrangement for the relevant scenario (for example SAP_COM_0940 or SAP_COM_0779 for Peppol).\n\n6. Enable the return channel from DRC-CE back to S/4HANA Cloud  \n   \u2022 Maintain the counterpart Communication System/Arrangement inside DRC-CE so that status updates and inbound messages can be pushed to S/4HANA Cloud.  \n   \u2022 Add or adjust the Communication User details to match what was created in step 5.\n\nOnce all six prerequisites are in place the \u201cCreate New Process\u201d (or \u201cCopy Process\u201d) function in the DRC extensibility tools becomes available, allowing you to define a new compliance process in the customer namespace.",

Use the SSCUI \u201cDefine Process Communication Through Cloud Services\u201d (Configuration Environment \u2192 Search)  \n   \u2022 Assign the relevant company code and eDocument process to one of SAP\u2019s delivered communication services (for example \u201cCloud Edition: Standard Integration \u2013 Peppol Exchange\u201d). This switches the process to SAP\u2019s cloud proxy that is already shipped and maintained by SAP.  \n\n2. If the eDocument process you need is not yet delivered by SAP:  \n   \u2022 Build your own side-by-side service on SAP BTP (or SAP Integration Suite iFlow).  \n   \u2022 Consume the released OData APIs of SAP DRC (API_EDOCUMENT_SRV / DOC_V2) to read or post eDocuments.  \n   \u2022 No proxy entry inside S/4HANA Cloud is required; your BTP app acts as the \u201cproxy\u201d and communicates with external networks or tax authorities.\n\n3. Typical prerequisites that still apply, even without an on-device proxy:  \n   \u2022 Activate the eDocument process and source document types via the relevant SSCUIs.  \n   \u2022 Maintain company-/party-ID, certificate trust to SAP Cloud Identity Services, and\u2014if you build a BTP proxy\u2014set up Cloud Connector or direct OAuth/SAML trust.\n\nKey takeaway  \nIn the Public-Cloud edition you can only select a SAP-delivered proxy (via the communication-service SSCUI) or handle the integration outside S/4HANA Cloud.

Developer Extensibility (available only in a 3-system landscape) lets you create an ABAP-managed table on SAP HANA with a CDS TABLE ENTITY.  \n   \u2022 Tooling: ADT in Eclipse \u2192 New \u2192 Data Definition \u2192 template \u201cDefine Table Entity\u201d.  \n   \u2022 The activation creates the physical table and registers it in a transportable package that you later ship with the Export/Import Software Collection apps.  \n   \u2022 You must follow the cloud-ready rules (client field mandatory, released APIs only, no direct cross-client access, etc.).  \n   Source: SAP Help \u201cCDS Table Entities\u201d (public-cloud release 2502).\n\n2. Key-user extensibility (Custom Business Object) can also persist data, but it is aimed at small configuration/lookup tables. It generates the table for you and exposes an OData service, yet offers no ABAP access inside DRC BAdIs.\n\nHow this maps to a new-country DRC process  \n\u2022 All country-specific logic still has to sit in the released BAdI EDOC_ADAPTOR_CLOUD (method IS_RELEVANT, FILL_\u200bEDOCUMENT_\u200bDATA, etc.).  \n\u2022 Your custom table may be read/updated in that BAdI implementation, provided the table entity is in a released package and the ABAP code is client-safe.  \n\u2022 Transport of both the table entity and the BAdI implementation happens together in the same software collection.\n\nWhat is not possible  \n\u00d7 Creating a database table purely from the DRC Extensibility UI (Manage Electronic Documents, Custom Fields, etc.).  \n\u00d7 Defining tables in a 2-system landscape (Developer Extensibility is unavailable there).  \n\u00d7 Using unreleased DDIC objects or classic SE11 tables in the public cloud.\n\nChecklist before you start  \n\u25a2 System is a 3-system landscape (DEV/Q/P).  \n\u25a2 Business role SAP_BR_DEVELOPER assigned.  \n\u25a2 ADT 23+ connected to the cloud tenant.  \n\u25a2 Create a package (Z\u2026) and transport request.  \n\u25a2 Define the CDS TABLE ENTITY with key client.  \n\u25a2 Activate and test with ABAP SQL.  \n\u25a2 Implement/extend BAdI EDOC_ADAPTOR_CLOUD and consume the table.  \n\u25a2 Add both objects to a Software Collection and transport.\n\nTherefore, the answer is \u201cYes, you can create your own persistence layer for a new country process,\u201d but only via Developer Extensibility (CDS Table Entity) and under the usual public-cloud restrictions.",

Alignment with expert answer:\n   - The generated answer aligns with the expert answer in confirming that an ABAP class can be created for some level of customization, but it provides more details on the limitations and alternatives.\n\nWhile the generated answer provides valuable information, it doesn't fully capture the extent of ABAP development possibilities in the public cloud for DRC extensibility. It focuses more on limitations than on the available options, potentially misleading users about the scope of what can be achieved.",

DETERMINE_EDOCUMENT_CLASS  \n   Return CV_EDOC_CLASS_NAME \u2192 the name of your country/region handler class (e.g. ZCL_EDOC_HANDLER_US).\n\n2. DETERMINE_PROCESS  \n   Return  \n   \u2022 CV_PROCESS_NAME\u2003\u2003\u2192 the eDocument process / type you want to run (e.g. ZUS_EINV), and  \n   \u2022 CV_PROCESS_VERSION \u2192 the 4-character version (e.g. 0001).\n\nFramework behaviour and constraints  \n\u2022 You can have several BAdI implementations (filtered e.g. by COUNTRY); they are executed sequentially, but the values set by the LAST implementation win\u2014so only one handler class/process is finally chosen.  \n\u2022 For a given source document and country/region, CL_EDOC_FACTORY_EXT can create only one eDocument instance; you therefore cannot trigger two independent processes from the same document.  \n\u2022 The BAdI merely chooses the handler; all mapping, submission and status logic is placed in that handler class and, if required, in subsequent extensibility BAdIs (EDOCUMENT_INT_CONN_EXT, EDOCUMENT_MESSAGE_EXT, etc.).\n\nTypical implementation steps  \n1. Create an enhancement implementation for spot ES_EDOCUMENT_EXT in ADT (Eclipse).  \n2. Within it, create a BAdI implementation for EDOCUMENT_BASE_EXT and maintain an appropriate filter value (e.g. COUNTRY = \u2018US\u2019).  \n3. Code the two interface methods to return the handler class name, process name and version.  \n4. Activate the implementation.  \n5. Make sure factory class CL_EDOC_FACTORY_EXT is linked to the required source document types in SPRO path  \n   Financial Accounting \u2192 Document and Reporting Compliance \u2192 Electronic Document \u2192 General Settings \u2192 Activate Additional eDocument Instance Creation.\n\nIn short  \nBAdI EDOCUMENT_BASE_EXT is the mandatory entry point that maps a source document to the correct custom eDocument process and the corresponding country/region handler class, enabling the extensible creation of electronic documents in SAP Document & Reporting Compliance.",

Development prerequisites  \n   \u2022 Business role SAP_BR_ADMINISTRATOR or SAP_BR_DEVELOPER (to use ADT).  \n   \u2022 ADT (Eclipse) with ABAP Cloud project pointing to your 3-system Cloud tenant.  \n   \u2022 Space \u201cABAP Cloud Development\u201d is assigned.  \n   \u2022 Software component ZLOCAL or ZSP are released for modifications.\n\n2. Create an enhancement implementation (ADT)  \n   a. In the Project Explorer choose New \u2192 Enhancement Implementation.  \n   b. Enhancement Spot: ES_EDOCUMENT_EXT  \n   c. Give it an implementation name, e.g. Z_EI_ES_EXT.\n\n3. Create the BAdI implementation inside the enhancement implementation  \n   a. BAdI definition: EDOCUMENT_BASE_EXT  \n   b. Filter values \u2013 mandatory at least the country filter:  \n      \u2013 COUNTRY/REGION = \u2018ES\u2019  \n      (Optional) SOURCE_TYPE = \u2018SD_INVOICE\u2019, COMPANY_CODE = \u2018ES01\u2019, \u2026 if you need finer granularity.\n\n4. Add an implementing class  \n   Example class name: ZCL_EDOC_ES_BASE_EXT  \n   (ADT automatically adds interface IF_EDOCUMENT_BASE_EXT.)\n\n```\nCLASS zcl_edoc_es_base_ext DEFINITION\n  PUBLIC FINAL CREATE PUBLIC.\n  PUBLIC SECTION.\n    INTERFACES if_edocument_base_ext.\nENDCLASS.\n\nCLASS zcl_edoc_es_base_ext IMPLEMENTATION.\n\n  METHOD if_edocument_base_ext~determine_edocument_class.\n    \"Return the handler class that knows how to build the Spanish XML\n    cv_edoc_class_name = 'ZCL_EDOC_HANDLER_ES'.     \"you create this in step 7\n  ENDMETHOD.\n\n  METHOD if_edocument_base_ext~determine_process.\n    \"Map each source doc. type to the eDocument process you created in the Fiori app\n    IF is_edocument-source_type = 'SD_INVOICE'.\n      cv_process_name    = 'ES_EINVOICE'.          \"Process key from \u2018Manage eDocument Process\u2019\n      cv_process_version = '0001'.\n    ENDIF.\n  ENDMETHOD.\n\nENDCLASS.\n```\n\n5. Activate the enhancement & BAdI implementation.  \n   The object list now contains:  \n   \u2022 Enhancement implementation Z_EI_ES_EXT  \n   \u2022 BAdI implementation Z_BDI_ES_BASE_EXT  \n   \u2022 Class ZCL_EDOC_ES_BASE_EXT\n\n6. Register the factory class that triggers the BAdI  \n   Fiori app \u201cManage Your Solution\u201d \u2192 \u201cConfigure Your Solution\u201d \u2192 search for activity \u201cActivate Additional eDocument Instance Creation\u201d.  \n   For every SOURCE TYPE that must create a Spanish eDocument (e.g. SD_INVOICE, FI_INVOICE) enter:  \n      Factory Class = CL_EDOC_FACTORY_EXT  \n   Save.  \n   (Without this entry the framework keeps using the standard factory and never calls your BAdI.)\n\n7. Provide / copy the Spanish handler class (only if you need additional logic)  \n   \u2022 Create class ZCL_EDOC_HANDLER_ES that subclasses the released standard CL_EDOCUMENT_EXT_ES or implements the needed public interfaces.  \n   \u2022 Typical tasks: fill special XML fields, perform additional validations, enrich partner data, etc.  \n   \u2022 Keep it RAP-safe: only public released methods may be used.\n\n8. Model the new process(es) in Fiori app \u201cManage eDocument Process\u201d  \n   \u2022 Process name = ES_EINVOICE (or any key you used in the BAdI).  \n   \u2022 Define process steps, versions, and assign the handler class in the \u201ceDocument Class\u201d column.  \n   \u2022 Activate.  \n\n9. General configuration (SSCUI) checks  \n   \u2022 \u201cActivate Source Document Types for Company Code\u201d \u2013 ensure SD_INVOICE, FI_INVOICE, \u2026 are active for your Spanish company codes.  \n   \u2022 \u201cDefine Interface Type\u201d and \u201cAssign Party-ID Type\u201d are optional if you use SAP standard messages; keep the shipped values.  \n\n10. Test  \n   \u2022 Post an SD billing document (VF01 / Fiori \u201cCreate Billing Document\u201d).  \n   \u2022 Open app \u201cManage Electronic Documents\u201d.  \n   \u2022 A new entry with eDocument Type \u2018ES_EINVOICE\u2019 should appear.  \n   \u2022 If nothing appears, verify:  \n       \u2013 Factory class is registered.  \n       \u2013 BAdI implementation is active and has COUNTRY = \u2018ES\u2019.  \n       \u2013 Your handler class name is returned correctly by the first BAdI method.  \n\n11. Typical troubleshooting hints (EDP note collection E28 / E12 etc.)  \n   \u2022 \u201cNo implementation found\u201d \u2192 filter values do not match runtime values.  \n   \u2022 \u201cThe object could not be created: class CL_EDOCUMENT_ES does not exist\u201d \u2192 Factory class not maintained or source type not activated.  \n   \u2022 Use ADT debugger; set breakpoint in IF_EDOCUMENT_BASE_EXT methods to ensure they are reached.\n\n12. Related BAdIs you might also extend for Spain  \n   \u2022 EDOCUMENT_INT_CONN_EXT  \u2013 outbound web-service call to AEAT.  \n   \u2022 EDOCUMENT_MESSAGE_EXT   \u2013 inbound response handling.  \n   \u2022 Custom-logic BAdIs available in the \u201cCustom Logic\u201d app (IBAN defaulting, Delivery Note, etc.).\n\nKey take-aways  \n\u2022 Always set the country filter to \u2018ES\u2019; otherwise the implementation will never fire in Cloud.  \n\u2022 Register CL_EDOC_FACTORY_EXT for each source document type; that is the Cloud-specific trigger mechanism.  \n\u2022 Only one custom eDocument instance per source document is supported in public edition.  \n\u2022 Develop and transport entirely in ADT; GUI transactions such as SE18/19 are not available.\n\nFollowing the twelve steps above you will have a fully working, upgrade-stable BAdI EDOCUMENT_BASE_EXT implementation for Spanish e-invoicing in SAP S/4HANA Cloud, public edition.",

    "generated_answer": "Below is the condensed checklist that SAP recommends you complete before you start adding UI adaptations, custom fields or BAdIs for a brand-new electronic-document process in Document and Reporting Compliance (DRC).\n\nThe steps are grouped in the order you normally execute them; each item is backed by at least one of the two independent SAP sources queried (Help Portal and internal DRC documentation).\n\n1. System & Software Level\n   \u2022 Your SAP S/4HANA (on-premise or Cloud) system must already contain the DRC Framework and latest content for the country.  \n     \u2013 Verified in table EDO_PROCESS, one entry for the new process must exist (sap_help_lookup).  \n   \u2022 All SAP Notes or upgrade \u201cpreparation tasks\u201d flagged as mandatory for the current release must be implemented (sap_help_lookup, edp_troubleshooting_search).\n\n2. Authorisations for Extensibility\n   \u2022 Key-user role SAP_BR_EXTENSIBILITY_SPECIALIST (catalog SAP_CORE_BC_EXT) available.  \n   \u2022 End-user role(s) with catalog SAP_CA_BC_EDOC_PC assigned; additional catalogs will be generated automatically for any new custom fields (sap_help_lookup).\n\n3. Activate Extensibility Frameworks\n   \u2022 UI Flexibility (Key-User Adaptation) layer open in client 100.  \n   \u2022 Custom Fields & Logic (CFL) framework active (IMG \u2192 Activate CFL; table SCFD_E2E status = ACTIVE) (sap_help_lookup).\n\n4. Mandatory Configuration Objects\n   4.1 Error Handling  \n       \u2013 SSCUI 104515 \u201cDefine Error Categories for Error Analysis Page\u201d; at least one category for the new process (sap_help_lookup).  \n   4.2 Process Definition  \n       \u2013 Check or create mapping in Fiori app \u201cAssign Electronic Document Processing\u201d (F4875) so the new process points to the correct output type / report class (sap_help_lookup).  \n   4.3 Output Determination  \n       \u2013 BRF+ function EDO_OUTPUT must contain a rule variant for the new process (sap_help_lookup).  \n   4.4 Communication (if the process exchanges XML with tax authority/Peppol)  \n       \u2013 Communication System (SSCUI 105352) and Arrangement (SSCUI 105353, scenario SAP_COM_0504) already set up (sap_help_lookup, sap_documentation_summary).  \n\n5. Cloud-Edition / BTP Prerequisites (only when you forward documents to DRC Cloud service)\n   \u2022 Sub-account created with booster \u201cSet Up an Account for SAP Document and Reporting Compliance, Cloud Edition\u201d.  \n   \u2022 Client SSL certificate uploaded in STRUST and mapped to HTTPS destination used by DRC (sap_documentation_summary).  \n   \u2022 Country/region process activated in DRC cockpit on BTP (sap_documentation_summary).\n\n6. Technical Switch-Ons Completed\n   \u2022 Tables created by mandatory SAP Notes (for example EDOPROCSTEPVAR, EDOINTDRCATTDETV) and TCI Note 3278685 executed if required (edp_troubleshooting_search).  \n   \u2022 If using Process Manager/AIF: SAP Note 2273379 (and country-specific notes, e.g., 2181282 for Italy) already in place (edp_troubleshooting_search).\n\n7. Transport / Lifecycle Planning\n   \u2022 Decide which content is client-dependent (UI changes, CFL fields \u2192 Software Collection) versus customizing transports (Error Categories, BRF+, communication data is re-entered manually).  \n   \u2022 Confirm that target QA/Prod tenants contain the same DRC content and extensibility frameworks.\n\nOnce the items above are ticked off, you can safely start the \u201cextensibility\u201d work for your new DRC process:\n\n\u2022 Key-User UI adaptation in Manage Electronic Documents (F4306)  \n\u2022 Creation & publication of Custom Fields (business context \u201cGeneral Electronic Document\u201d)  \n\u2022 Optional CFL BAdI implementations (BADI_EDOC_CFL) for defaulting/validation  \n\u2022 Testing \u2192 transport/export \u2192 redeploy in production\n\nFollowing this prerequisite checklist prevents the typical errors raised when UI/CFL objects are created before the underlying DRC process, certificates, BRF+ rules or AIF artefacts are in place.",

Here's the reasoning:\n\n1. Accuracy: The answer correctly states that Private Cloud customers in Italy can extend the existing eDocument process for customer invoices. It aligns with the expert answer in confirming this possibility.\n\n2. Comprehensiveness: The generated answer provides a detailed explanation of various extension possibilities, including configuration-level extensions, ABAP/BAdI extensions, value mapping, job automation, and UI extensions. This level of detail goes beyond the expert answer and offers valuable insights.\n\n3. Relevance to Private Cloud: The answer specifically mentions that Private Cloud edition (PCE) runs the same ABAP code line as on-premise, which is relevant to the question's context.\n\n4. Technical details: The answer provides specific BAdI names and extension points, which can be helpful for implementation.\n\n5. Limitations and guardrails: The answer includes important information about technical guardrails and limits, which is crucial for safe implementation of extensions.\n\nHowever, there are some aspects where the answer falls short:\n\n1. Tool context utilization: The generated answer doesn't fully utilize the information provided by the sap_documentation_summary tool. For example, it doesn't mention the legal requirements and compliance aspects, which are crucial for Italian e-invoicing.\n\n2. Communication and signing: The tool output mentions important details about communication through CPI and document signing, which are not reflected in the generated answer.\n\n3.

Special scenarios: The tool output mentions support for special scenarios like down payments, which is not included in the generated answer.\n\nWhile the generated answer provides valuable information and is largely accurate, it misses some important context-specific details that were available in the tool output.

Technical accuracy: The answer provides specific technical details, such as the BAdI name (EDOC_COCKPIT_ACTION), relevant transaction codes (SE19), and customizing views (EDOCV_ACTIONS), which are crucial for implementation.\n\n6. Explanation of limitations: The answer clarifies that this extension is not possible in Public Cloud, which is an important distinction for the user to understand.\n\n7. Additional relevant information: The answer goes beyond the basic question to provide information on what can be done with the extension (e.g., adding new UI actions, hiding or overriding SAP-delivered actions) and how to handle authorization.\n\nOverall, the generated answer not only fully addresses the original question but also provides comprehensive, technically accurate, and practically useful information for implementing the extension in SAP S/4HANA Private Cloud.",

    "generated_answer": "Yes \u2013 in an SAP S/4HANA Private Cloud system you are allowed to add your own push-button or change the behaviour of an existing one in the eDocument Cockpit.  \nThe framework object you extend is the released BAdI EDOC_COCKPIT_ACTION; it is available only in on-premise and private-cloud stacks (it is not released in Public Cloud).\n\nWhat the cockpit lets you do  \n\u2022 Add a new UI action that appears on the toolbar or in the \u201cMore\u201d menu for the chosen eDocument process.  \n\u2022 Hide or override an SAP-delivered action.  \n\u2022 Run any ABAP logic when the user clicks the button (call a web service, regenerate XML, send e-mail, update status, etc.).\n\nTechnically how to implement it\n\n1. Create the BAdI implementation  \n   \u2022 Transaction SE19 (classic) or ADT in Eclipse  \n   \u2022 Enhancement spot ES_EDOCUMENT_CLOUD \u2192 BAdI EDOC_COCKPIT_ACTION  \n   \u2022 Implement two interface methods  \n     \u2013 GET_ACTIONS              \u2192 Supply the button(s) you want to add (ID, text, tooltip, icon).  \n     \u2013 EXECUTE_ACTION       \u2192 Put the runtime logic for each custom button ID.\n\n2. Register the action so that the cockpit knows when it is allowed  \n   \u2022 IMG \u2192 Cross-Application Components \u2192 Document & Reporting Compliance \u2192 Framework Settings \u2192 Maintain Cockpit Actions (view EDOCV_ACTIONS).  \n   \u2022 Enter the eDocument Process (for example Z_MYPROC), the Action ID you returned in GET_ACTIONS, and optionally a filter for specific status values.\n\n3. (Optional) Maintain process flow / status checks  \n   \u2022 View EDOPROCFUNCASGV or CDS I_EdocActionStep to say in which process steps the action is valid.  \n   \u2022 If you want a mass action, make sure you also add an entry to table EDOACTNWEBUIMETHV that maps the action to your UI handler class (see class CL_EDOC_DCC_ACTION_WEBUI in the standard code \u2013 tool output shows how SAP does it).\n\n4. Transport & authorise  \n   \u2022 Transport your BAdI class and customizing.  \n   \u2022 Give users the usual cockpit role (SAP_BR_EDOC_ADMIN) or object F_EDOC_ADM; add any extra checks inside EXECUTE_ACTION.\n\nRelevant evidence from the tools you saw above  \n\u2022 sap_help_lookup: explains that the classic enhancement spot EDOC_COCKPIT_ACTION is the way to \u201cadd button text & tooltip\u201d and \u201cwrite execution logic (method EXECUTE_ACTION)\u201d, and that you must maintain view EDOCV_ACTIONS.  \n\u2022 abap_method_codebase_search: shows SAP\u2019s own action-handling classes (CL_EDOC_DCC_ACTION, CL_EDOC_DCC_UTILITY) that your code will run together with.  \n\u2022 edp_troubleshooting_search: confirms missing buttons are usually solved in EDOPROCFUNCASGV / EDOCV_ACTIONS \u2013 same customizing you will touch.  \n\u2022 sap_documentation_summary: states that the cockpit is extensible via BAdIs in private-cloud systems.\n\nWhat you cannot do in Public Cloud  \nThe BAdI is not released there; only the predefined set of actions is available.\n\nSo, for a custom-developed eDocument process in S/4HANA Private Cloud you can safely extend the cockpit with your own action button by implementing BAdI EDOC_COCKPIT_ACTION and registering the action in view EDOCV_ACTIONS.",

Create / adjust the implementing ABAP logic\n   a. In SE24 create a subclass of CL_EDOC_HANDLER_BASE (e.g. ZCL_EDOC_MYPROC_HDLR).  \n   b. Add a public method that will realise the new step (e.g. IF_EDOC_HANDLER~SUBMIT_CLOUD).  \n   c. Do NOT call COMMIT WORK in the method; the framework will commit.  \n   d. If you need to influence mapping or further outbound steps, use BAdI EDOCUMENT_BASE_EXT (filter value = your process).\n\n2. Add the PROCESS STEP that calls the method\n   App: \u201cManage eDocument Process\u201d \u2192 open your process \u2192 \u201cProcess Steps\u201d  \n   \u2022 New entry:\n     \u2013 Step   = e.g. SUBMIT_CLOUD  \n     \u2013 Version = STD  \n     \u2013 Handler Class = ZCL_EDOC_MYPROC_HDLR  \n     \u2013 Handler Method = SUBMIT_CLOUD  \n     \u2013 Included = blank (unless the step is implicitly executed by another one)  \n   \u2022 Create in addition an EMPTY step (mandatory placeholder for every process).\n\n3. Define Status Flag logic for the step\n   Still in \u201cProcess Steps\u201d: maintain  \n   \u2022 Status Flag Check (which flags must be set so the step may run).  \n   \u2022 Status Flag Change (which flags the framework sets if the step ends with RESULT = OK, ERROR or WARNING).  \n   Tip: afterwards open \u201cProcess Status Determination\u201d and make sure each new flag combination points to a Process Status text (otherwise cockpit dumps).\n\n4. Create the ACTION that end-users (or background job) will trigger\n   a. Navigation: \u201cActions incl. Variants for a Process\u201d  \n      \u2013 Action = 4-char key, e.g. SBCL (Submit Cloud)  \n      \u2013 Variant = STD (or your internal naming)  \n      \u2013 Text    = \u201cSubmit to Cloud Edition\u201d  \n   b. Link the action to the step:\n      Activity \u201cProcess Steps Executed by an Action\u201d  \n      \u2013 Enter Action SBCL | Variant STD  \n      \u2013 Line 10: SUBMIT_CLOUD | STD | Included = blank (\u2192 single explicit step)\n\n5.

Transport and test interactively\n   \u2022 EDOC_COCKPIT / Manage Electronic Documents \u2192 find a test record.  \n   \u2022 New button \u201cSubmit to Cloud Edition\u201d appears only when Status Flag Check matches.  \n   \u2022 Execute; inspect application log (SLG1 object EDOCUMENT).  \n   \u2022 Verify flag change and final process status.\n\n8.

    "generated_answer": "Yes. In an SAP S/4HANA Cloud, private-edition (formerly \u201cprivate cloud\u201d) system you can add your own fields to the Manage Electronic Documents (\u201cEDOC_MANAGE\u201d) and eDocument Cockpit (EDOC_COCKPIT) apps.  \nSAP delivers two Business Add-Ins in the Document & Reporting Compliance framework that were created precisely for this purpose; they are available in the Custom Fields and Logic Fiori app or in the classical SE19 BAdI builder.\n\nWhat you do\n\n1. Create / publish the field  \n   \u2022 Launch \u201cCustom Fields and Logic\u201d \u2192 + \u2192 choose the business context \u201cDocument Compliance\u201d (or the SD/FI context that already contains the value, e.g. \u201cBilling Document\u201d).  \n   \u2022 Define the data element, label, data type and press Publish.\n\n2. (Optional) physically add the field to the eDocument tables  \n   \u2022 Header\u2003table EDOC_HEADER \u2192 include CI_EDOC_HEADER  \n   \u2022 Item\u2003\u2003table EDOC_ITEM\u2003 \u2192 include CI_EDOC_ITEM  \n   If you only need the value on the UI you may skip this step; if you want it saved in the EDOC database record or in the XML sent to the tax authority you must append it.\n\n3. Persist the value when the eDocument is created  \n   \u2022 Implement BAdI \u201ceDocument Custom Fields\u201d (enhancement spot BADI_EDOC_CUSTOM_FIELDS).  \n   \u2022 In method MAP_SOURCE2EDOC read the source structures (VBRK/VBRP, BKPF/BSEG, etc.) and move your value to CS_HEADER-ZZ_FIELD or CS_ITEM-ZZ_FIELD.\n\n4. Show the field in the cockpit UI  \n   \u2022 Implement BAdI \u201ceDocument Custom Fields (UI)\u201d (IF_EDOC_BADI_CUST_FIELDS_UI).  \n     \u2013 GET_UI_FIELDS \u2192 return the list of field names that must appear as columns / detail fields.  \n     \u2013 FILL_UI_DATA (optional) \u2192 supply values if they are not already present.\n\n5. Transport and test  \n   \u2022 Move the append and both BAdI implementations through your CTS path (DEV \u2192 QA \u2192 PRD).  \n   \u2022 In EDOC_COCKPIT use \u201cPersonalize \u2192 Adapt Columns\u201d or open the document detail; the new field should be visible and populated.\n\nKey points & limitations\n\n\u2022 Only the private-edition system lets you perform DDIC appends (CI_EDOC*). In the public-edition you still create the field and implement the same BAdIs, but you cannot modify the tables directly.  \n\u2022 The same two BAdIs are offered from release 2022 FPS1 onward; earlier on-premise releases use identical classic BAdI names.  \n\u2022 If the field must be part of the outbound XML you additionally enhance the XSLT or format-class mapping inside the same persistence BAdI.  \n\u2022 No \u201creference content\u201d or activation task is required; as soon as the BAdIs are active the cockpit framework generates the OData metadata again and exposes the field.\n\nTherefore, in SAP S/4HANA Cloud, private edition you can fully extend the Manage Electronic Documents / eDocument Cockpit apps with custom fields, both on database and UI level, by using the delivered BAdIs and (optionally) a DDIC append.",

Configure the new process (Fiori app \u201cManage eDocument Process\u201d)  \n   a) Create a new Process ID (either copy one of SAP\u2019s templates or start from scratch).  \n   b) Maintain:  \n      \u2013 Actions (what the framework should call).  \n      \u2013 Status Flow (arrows between statuses).  \n      \u2013 Assignment of eDocument Status \u2194 Process Status (table EDOMETASTATUS1V behind the app).  \n   c) Activate company codes and assign your process to document types if relevant (SD/FI configuration apps).\n\n4. Build the data foundation (CDS views)  \n   \u2022 Create one or more CDS views that read the source application (e.g. billing, FI).  \n   \u2022 These views supply all fields that must be placed in the XML.\n\n5. Provide a \u201chook\u201d so the framework is triggered  \n   \u2022 Implement the source-application BAdI (e.g. SD billing BAdI) that calls CL_EDOCUMENT_CREATE_API=>CREATE_EDOCUMENT(...) or the RAP API to create an entry in table EDOCUMENT with status \u201cCreated\u201d.\n\n6.

Enable deletion from cockpit (optional)  \n   \u2022 In your DELETE action call CL_EDOCUMENT_EXT_ES=>PROCESS_DELETE_GLOBAL which then leads to your IF_EDOCUMENT_EXT_ES~DELETE_FROM_DB method.\n\n9. Test end-to-end in DEV and QAS  \n   \u2022 Run \u201cManage Electronic Documents\u201d or \u201cEDOC_COCKPIT\u201d to create / submit / cancel.  \n   \u2022 Verify that XML is correct and Integration Suite flow reaches the tax authority or Peppol Access Point.  \n   \u2022 Attempt to reverse the source invoice to confirm RESTRICT_CANCELLATION behaves as designed.\n\n10.

    "generated_answer": "Root cause  \n1. For Malaysian \u201cImport Invoice\u201d eDocuments the field <ReferenceNumberOfCustomsForm> is filled by standard SAP \u2013 no custom code is called at that moment.  \n2. The value is taken from the purchase-order header text whose text type you maintained in Customizing parameter IMPORT_TEXT_TYPE (delivered as F01 = \u201cHeader Text\u201d). See SAP Help > Document and Reporting Compliance > Malaysia > \u201cCreate Electronic Import Invoice \u2013 prerequisite master data\u201d.  \n3. The framework permits only the characters A-Z, 0-9 and space in this field. When any other character is found (line-feed, \u201c/\u201d, \u201c-\u201d, \u201c.\u201d \u2026) message EDOCUMENT_EU 041 is raised; the XML is not stored and therefore the PDF cannot be rendered.  \n4. Although you wrote a custom routine that tries to read the GR (MIGO) text, the standard mapping (constant IMPORT_TEXT_TYPE) runs first; consequently it still picks up the PO text\u2014even if it is empty. An \u201cempty\u201d SAPscript text, however, still contains line-feed characters, so the validation fails.\n\nHow to solve it\n\nA. Master-data / configuration fix (recommended)  \nStep 1  SPRO  \u2192 Financial Accounting  \u2192 SAP Document and Reporting Compliance  \n        \u2192 Country/Region-Specific Settings  \u2192 Malaysia  \n        \u2192 Maintain Reference Number of Customs Form  \n        \u2013 Verify that IMPORT_TEXT_TYPE is the text type you really want to use (F01 is SAP standard).  \nStep 2  In every import PO enter the customs-form number in the \u201cTexts\u201d tab, header level, text type F01, using only A\u2013Z, 0\u20139 and blanks.  \nStep 3  Reverse the rejected eDocument, correct the PO header text and regenerate the eDocument; the XML and PDF are now produced without error.\n\nB. If the reference must come from Goods-Receipt (MIGO) or you need to cleanse it automatically  \nImplement BAdI EDOC_ADAPTOR \u2192 method SET_OUTPUT_DATA with the in-app \u201cCustom Logic\u201d app (Business Context \u201ceDocument: Malaysia Document Compliance\u201d).  \nExample code fragment:\n\n  DATA(lv_ref) = edoc_header-customs_ref.          \"value filled by standard  \n  \"Replace everything that is not A-Z or 0-9 with space  \n  REPLACE ALL OCCURRENCES OF REGEX '[^A-Z0-9 ]' IN lv_ref WITH ''.  \n  \"Or take the reference from the GR text instead  \n  IF lv_ref IS INITIAL.  \n    lv_ref = get_gr_text( edoc_header-reference_belnr ).  \"own helper  \n  ENDIF.  \n  edoc_header-customs_ref = lv_ref.\n\nThrowing no exception lets the framework continue with the cleansed value; throwing cx_edocument would block creation until the source document is corrected.\n\nC. Typical recovery procedure for already-created MIRO documents  \n1. In eDocument cockpit set status \u201cCancelled\u201d for the faulty document.  \n2. Correct the PO header text (or implement the BAdI and transport it).  \n3.

Accuracy: The generated answer correctly identifies the core issue - that after switching to the preview tenant, the framework lost the mapping for the DISPL_HTML step. This aligns with the expert answer's mention of incorrect logical port and URL path determination.\n\n2. Comprehensiveness: The generated answer provides a more detailed and step-by-step approach to resolving the issue compared to the expert answer. It covers SOA Manager configuration, AIF interface determination, eDocument process-step customizing, transport consistency, BTP destinations/credentials, and relevant SAP Notes.\n\n3. Technical Depth: The generated answer goes into greater technical detail, explaining the EDOCUMENT034 error, the missing building blocks, and the specific customizations needed in various SAP transactions (SOAMANAGER, /AIF/CUST, SPRO).\n\n4. Solution Approach: Both answers suggest updating the SOA Manager configuration, but the generated answer provides a more comprehensive solution, including AIF customizing and eDocument framework adjustments.\n\n5. Alignment with Tool Output: The generated answer aligns well with the sap_documentation_summary tool output, addressing the need to configure logical ports and proxies in the SOA Manager.\n\nHowever, the answer is not fully helpful because:\n\n1. It doesn't directly address the specific error message mentioned in the question (\"/cxf/PeppolLookup\").\n2. The answer is quite long and technical, which might be overwhelming for some users.\n3. It doesn't explicitly mention checking the URL path for '/cxf/PeppolLookup' as suggested in the expert answer.\n\nIn conclusion, while the generated answer provides a more comprehensive solution, it could be more focused on the specific error mentioned in the question.

Misalignments and omissions:\n   - The answer suggests creating a custom Adobe Form for incoming ZUGFeRD invoices, but the documentation doesn't explicitly mention this requirement for incoming invoices.\n   - The answer doesn't mention the possibility of displaying HTML representations, which is mentioned in the documentation as an option, especially for cloud customers.\n   - The documentation states that PDF/A-3 files can be displayed for billing documents, but the answer doesn't make this distinction clear.\n   - The answer doesn't mention the use of Adobe Document Services (ADS) for creating graphical representations of invoices, which is mentioned in the documentation.\n\n3. Incomplete addressing of the original question:\n   - The original question specifically asked about displaying the PDF that originally represents the ZUGFeRD invoice, but the answer focuses more on generating a new PDF from the XML data.\n   - The answer doesn't fully address how to handle the original PDF sent by the supplier, which was a key part of the user's question.\n\nWhile the generated answer provides some useful information, it doesn't fully align with the authoritative documentation and doesn't completely address the user's specific question about displaying the original PDF from the supplier.",

    "generated_answer": "Why you currently see only \u201cDisplay HTML\u201d\n\n\u2022 The cockpit does not simply show any PDF file that may have been pushed as an attachment.  \n\u2022 Instead, the \u201cDisplay PDF\u201d button is enabled only when the eDocument Framework can generate (or locate) a PDF that is linked to the document type through the standard PDF-generation logic.  \n\u2022 If no PDF form is assigned in Customizing, the framework hides the PDF option and shows only \u201cDisplay HTML\u201d.\n\nWhat SAP expects for incoming ZUGFeRD invoices\n\n1. The incoming XML is stored in the cockpit (you already achieve this with DCPPUSHSERVICE).  \n2. When the user chooses Display \u2192 Display PDF, the framework calls an Adobe Form that turns the XML into a human-readable PDF/A-3.  \n3. The generated file is kept in table EDOCUMENT_ATTACH and can be displayed or downloaded again.\n\nHow to make the button appear\n\nIMG path  \nSPRO \u2192 Cross-Application Components \u2192 General Application Functions \u2192 Document Compliance \u2192 Framework \u2192 Settings for PDF Generation \u2192 Specify Output Forms for PDF Generation\n\nMaintain at least one entry:\n\n\u2022 Company Code \u2026\u2026\u2026 (or blank = all)  \n\u2022 eDocument Country/Region \u2026\u2026\u2026 DE  \n\u2022 eDocument Type \u2026\u2026\u2026 DE_INCO (Germany \u2013 Incoming eInvoice)  \n\u2022 File Type \u2026\u2026\u2026 PDF  \n\u2022 Adobe Form \u2026\u2026\u2026 Z_DE_INCO_ZUGFERD (your own copy) \u2013 or any form that can print ZUGFeRD\n\nSave and transport.\n\nResult in the cockpit\n\n1. Re-open EDOC_COCKPIT (or the Fiori \u201cManage Electronic Documents\u201d app).  \n2. Select an incoming ZUGFeRD entry.  \n3. In the top menu choose Display \u2192 Display PDF (or Download \u2192 Download PDF).  \n   \u2013 If the XML is present, a PDF/A-3 is rendered.  \n   \u2013 If the XML is missing or the form is wrong you receive EDOCUMENT185 \u201cNo file found \u2026 PDF cannot be generated\u201d.\n\nImportant notes\n\n\u2022 SAP does not deliver a ready-made ZUGFeRD incoming form; copy any country template (e.g. EDO_IT_INCO_INVOICE_CLOUD_V1) to a Z* form and adapt the layout.  \n\u2022 The button is context-sensitive; it appears only for those processes (e.g. \u201cGermany \u2013 Incoming eInvoice\u201d) for which a form is maintained.  \n\u2022 The original supplier-sent PDF can still be stored as an additional attachment, but the cockpit will show the PDF generated via the form. Users can open the original file from the Attachments tab, not via the Display menu.\n\nSo, to display the supplier\u2019s invoice as PDF in the cockpit you only need to (a) assign an Adobe Form in \u201cSpecify Output Forms for PDF Generation\u201d and (b) ensure the XML is saved for the eDocument. The cockpit will automatically add the \u201cDisplay PDF\u201d function once this customizing is in place.",

    "generated_answer": "Why the certificate is needed  \n\u2022 In the Peppol integration scenario (communication arrangement SAP_COM_0529) SAP S/4HANA Cloud is the server and the external sender (Peppol Access Point / SAP Integration Suite / other middleware) is the client.  \n\u2022 Basic authentication is not allowed, so the client must identify itself during the TLS handshake with an X.509 client certificate (\u201cmutual TLS\u201d).  \n\u2022 You therefore upload the PUBLIC part of the client\u2019s certificate to the \u201cCommunication User\u201d in S/4HANA Cloud so that the system can compare the thumb-print it receives at runtime with the one you stored.\n\nWhere the certificate comes from  \nIt is NOT generated by SAP S/4HANA Cloud; it must be provided by the system that will call the inbound OData/SOAP endpoints:\n\n1. If the caller is SAP Integration Suite (Cloud Integration tenant)  \n   \u2022 Open your tenant \u2192 Monitor \u2192 Keystore.  \n   \u2022 Select the entry you intend to use (or create a new one), press \u201cDownload Certificate\u201d.  \n   \u2022 The file you receive (usually *.crt / *.cer / Base-64 PEM) is the certificate you upload in S/4HANA Cloud.\n\n2. If the caller is a Peppol Access-Point operated by a partner  \n   \u2022 The Access-Point operator creates a CSR, has it signed by a trusted public CA, and gives you the resulting certificate file.  \n   \u2022 You simply upload that file.\n\n3. If you run your own on-premise adapter behind SAP Cloud Connector  \n   \u2022 Generate a key pair in your local keystore, create a CSR, have it signed by a CA that is on SAP\u2019s global trust list (SAP Note 2801396).  \n   \u2022 Upload the signed public certificate to S/4HANA Cloud.\n\nAccepted file/format in the \u201cMaintain Communication Users\u201d app  \n\u2022 X.509 certificate, Base-64-encoded (.crt, .cer, .pem) or DER (.cer) \u2013 only the public key, no private key, no PFX/P12.  \n\u2022 Must be issued by a CA contained in SAP\u2019s trust store (otherwise the TLS handshake will fail).  \n\u2022 Recommended key length \u22652048 bit, SHA-256 signature.\n\nConfiguration sequence in S/4HANA Cloud (short recap)  \n1. Maintain Communication Users \u2192 Create user (e.g. PEPPOL_IN) \u2192 Authentication = \u201cCertificate\u201d \u2192 Upload the certificate file above.  \n2. Communication Systems \u2192 Create / open system \u2192 In \u201cUsers for Inbound Communication\u201d assign PEPPOL_IN and set \u201cSSL Client Certificate\u201d.  \n3. Communication Arrangements \u2192 New \u2192 Scenario SAP_COM_0529 \u2192 choose the system; for each inbound service select \u201cSSL Client Certificate\u201d.\n\nTroubleshooting tips  \n\u2022 If the inbound call still fails, check:  \n  \u2013 CA of the certificate is on SAP\u2019s list (Note 2801396).  \n  \u2013 Certificate has not expired and its thumb-print matches the one shown in the Communication User.  \n  \u2013 The external system presents the correct certificate (Wireshark / tenant trace).  \n\nSo, the missing certificate must be obtained from \u2013 and is owned by \u2013 the external system that will push the Peppol documents to SAP S/4HANA Cloud. Once you have its public X.509 certificate in .crt/.cer/.pem format, upload it to the communication user and continue with the remaining SAP help steps.",

    "generated_answer": "What the status means  \n\u2022 \u201cReceived by sender access point\u201d is raised by the Peppol Exchange service when it has already accepted the AS-4 transmission from the sender and tries to forward the payload to your on-premise or private-cloud back-end (EDP framework).  \n\u2022 Before the status can move on to \u201cReceived by receiver access point / Delivered to back-end\u201d, Peppol Exchange calls the inbound web service that you exposed through SAP Cloud Connector (or a public endpoint).  \n\u2022 The HTTP-401 reply that Peppol Exchange receives is generated by your SAP system and literally says \u201cAnmeldung fehlgeschlagen \u2013 Log-on failed\u201d. Therefore the document remains stuck.\n\nEvidence from SAP sources  \n\u2022 SAP Note 2926868 and the official Peppol Exchange guide (sap_documentation_summary tool) list 401 Unauthorized as a symptom of wrong credentials or Cloud Connector mapping.  \n\u2022 The EDP troubleshooting knowledge base (edp_troubleshooting_search tool) associates 401 with error codes DCP-GOR-ERR-001 / AUTHORIZATION_FAILED and points to missing/invalid back-end user authorisation.\n\nMost frequent root-causes and how to fix them\n\n1. Wrong user / password maintained in Peppol Exchange\n   \u2013 Connection Management \u2192 System Connections \u2192 column \u201cUser\u201d.  \n   \u2013 This must be a real dialog/technical user that exists in the back-end client, not the User Management entry of the Peppol dashboard.  \n   \u2013 Check that the password was not pasted with trailing blanks and does not exceed the 200-character limit (see Note 2926868).  \n   \u2013 Reset the password in SU01, update it in the dashboard, save, then press \u201cTest Connection\u201d.\n\n2. User exists but lacks authorisations\n   \u2013 Required: S_SERVICE for the inbound service, S_EDOC_RFC, S_RFC, and the specific authorisation objects listed in Note 2949379.  \n   \u2013 Log on with that user and run SU53 or ST01 when the test call is executed to see missing objects; add them to the role and retest.\n\n3. Cloud Connector or Location ID mismatch\n   \u2013 In Cloud Connector, check the exposed host/port and virtual hostname.  \n   \u2013 The same host name (and the identical Location ID, if one is filled) must be entered in Connection Management.  \n   \u2013 Make sure the resource path /sap/bc/srt/\u2026 (or the SICF node you expose) is listed and \u201cAccessible = true\u201d.\n\n4. ICF service inactive / wrong client\n   \u2013 Activate the inbound SICF node delivered by SAP Note/BC-Set for Peppol (e.g. /sap/bc/srt/rfc/EDOC_PEPPOL_INBOUND).  \n   \u2013 The node must point to the client where the user is created.\n\n5. Proxy or firewall returns 401\n   \u2013 If you use a corporate proxy between Cloud Connector and the ABAP system, 401 can originate there. Check the proxy allow-list.\n\nValidation steps\n\nA. In the Peppol Exchange Connection Management app, press \u201cTest Connection\u201d.  \n   \u2022 Status 200 OK confirms the credential and Cloud Connector settings.  \n   \u2022 401 reproduces the problem\u2014check SU53 in the back-end immediately after the test.\n\nB. In the back-end, call transaction SICF \u2192 Service Test on the same node, provide the user/password that is stored in Connection Management. You must receive \u201cHTTP/1.1 200 OK\u201d.\n\nC. Once the test returns 200, go to the Document Monitor and choose \u201cReprocess\u201d (or wait for the next automatic retry). The stuck document will move to \u201cDelivered to receiver access point\u201d.\n\nQuick checklist (use as run-book)  \n\u2610 Reset / re-enter user password in SU01 and in Connection Management  \n\u2610 Assign missing authorisation objects (S_SERVICE, S_EDOC_RFC, S_RFC \u2026)  \n\u2610 Verify host name + Location ID in Cloud Connector vs. Connection Management  \n\u2610 Ensure inbound SICF node is active in correct client  \n\u2610 Test Connection \u2192 expect 200 OK  \n\u2610 Reprocess document in Monitor\n\nFollowing these steps resolves practically all cases where Peppol documents are stuck in status \u201cReceived by sender access point\u201d with HTTP 401.",

Comprehensiveness: The answer provides a detailed, step-by-step guide that covers all aspects of enabling the \"Settlement Management Documents\" source type for the France eInvoice eDocument Process. It includes information on customizing, activation steps, and ABAP artifacts, which addresses all parts of the user's question.\n\n2. Accuracy: The information provided in the generated answer aligns well with both the expert answer and the additional context from the sap_documentation_summary tool. It correctly identifies the need for a specific mapping class (CL_EDOC_MAP_FR_B2B_STLMT) and lists the methods that need to be implemented or redefined, which matches the expert answer.\n\n3. Enhanced detail: The generated answer goes beyond the expert answer by providing additional context and steps, such as enabling the source type, assigning eDocument types, and providing mandatory value mappings. This extra information helps to create a more complete picture of the process.\n\n4. Structured presentation: The answer is well-organized with clear sections, making it easy for the user to follow the steps required to enable and configure the settlement document mapping.\n\n5. Practical guidance: The answer includes a \"Test run\" section, which provides practical steps for verifying that the configuration and mapping are working correctly. This goes beyond the initial question but adds significant value for the user.\n\n6. Technical accuracy: The answer correctly identifies the superclass (CL_EDOC_MAP_FR_B2B_SD) and the methods that need to be redefined, matching the expert answer. It also provides additional technical details about tables, views, and Fiori apps that are relevant to the process.\n\nIn conclusion, the generated answer not only fully addresses the user's question but also provides additional valuable information that would help in implementing and testing the solution. It successfully combines the information from the expert answer with additional context to create a comprehensive and accurate response.",

Once IS_RELEVANT returns ABAP_TRUE, the subsequent method DETERMINE_PROCESS (also in CL_EDOCUMENT_FR_INV) contains dedicated logic for `STLMT_INV` that maps Sales-Area customising (VKORG / VTWEG / SPART) and fills the simulation structures used by the UBL/Peppol mapper (see CASE branch for `cl_edoc_source_stlmt=>gc_src_stlmt_inv`).\n\nThis single addition therefore completes the enablement pathway:\n\u2022 IS_RELEVANT lets STLMT documents through \u2192  \n\u2022 DETERMINE_PROCESS and CL_EDOC_MAP_UBL_STLMT_* perform the French-specific mapping \u2192  \n\u2022 The eDocument is saved and processed like any other FR-INV instance.",

New CASE branch  \n   ```\n   WHEN cl_edoc_source_stlmt=>gc_src_stlmt_inv.\n   ```\n   \u2013 marks the code path that is executed when the eDocument is created from a Settlement-Management billing document (rebate / charge-back etc.).\n\n2.

Sales-area based customising lookup (same logic that already existed for SD invoices, now reused for SM):  \n   ```\n   ls_edofrproctvta = go_edoc_fr_inv_db->select_edofrproctvta(\n                        iv_vkorg = ls_sm_data-document_header-vkorg\n                        iv_vtweg = ls_sm_data-document_header-vtweg\n                        iv_spart = ls_sm_data-document_header-spart ).\n   IF ls_edofrproctvta-proc_type IS NOT INITIAL.\n     lv_proc_type = ls_edofrproctvta-proc_type.\n   ENDIF.\n   ```\n   This fills LV_PROC_TYPE with the process category (B2B domestic, B2B intra-EU, etc.) that is later converted into the concrete process name (FRB2BCINV, FRB2BICINV \u2026).\n\n4. The rest of the standard logic (tax-code scan, BP-status check, final mapping to FRB2B* processes) then continues unchanged.\n\nIn short: the enhancement adds a dedicated \u201cSettlement Management\u201d branch that (a) fetches the SM document data, (b) sets KOART = \u2018D\u2019, (c) evaluates sales-area customising via EDOFRPROCTVTA, and (d) passes the derived LV_PROC_TYPE to the existing determination logic \u2013 thereby enabling the creation of eDocuments for Settlement-Management invoices in the France B2B scenario.",

The only field that cannot be taken from the simulated billing\n   document is the invoice-type code, because in Settlement Management\n   the legal meaning is driven by LFART rather than FKART.\n   Therefore we override `fill_invoice_type_code` and look up\n   LFART in the dedicated value-mapping table\n   `INVOICE_TYPE_CODE_SM`.\n\nIf later you need to map additional Settlement-specific elements\n(e.g. special references or \u201cbilling reference\u201d logic), you can\nre-define the corresponding `fill_*` methods in the same way, but for\nan initial enablement the code above is all that is required.",

FR_B2B settlement documents are mapped with class CL_EDOC_MAP_FR_B2B_STLMT (see SAP standard implementation shown by the ABAP code search above).  \n   Creating an enhancement/sub-class that inherits from CL_EDOC_MAP_FR_B2B_SD and is assigned to the FR_B2BSTLMT source type moves your logic into the mapping pipeline.\n\n2. The single field you have to expose is KOMLFK-CONTRACT (10 characters, the condition-contract number).  \n   The XML element path used by the France B2B UBL mapping is `ContractReferencedDocument/ID`, technically addressed through the deep component `rs_contract-id-base-content`.\n\n3. The check on `KOMLFK-CONTRACT_TYPE` (\u201c1\u201d = Condition Contract) follows the pattern found in SAP\u2019s own settlement-specific classes (e.g. CL_EDOC_MAP_SA_STLMT) and avoids populating the tag for other settlement use-cases where no contract reference is allowed.\n\nConfiguration steps (summary)\n\n1. Create the new ABAP class ZCL_EDOC_MAP_FR_B2B_STLMT (or implement an implicit enhancement in the SAP class, if permitted).  \n2. Redefine FILL_CONTRACT_REFERENCE as shown.  \n3. In IMG \u2192 Document and Reporting Compliance \u2192 eDocument \u2192 Outbound Processing \u2192 Assign Mapping Class, assign your new class to source type FR_B2BSTLMT.  \n4. Test\u2010run the generation of a settlement-management invoice; the resulting XML now contains the correct `<cbc:ID>` under `<cac:ContractReferencedDocument>`.\n\nWith this small redefinition the contract number becomes part of the France B2B electronic invoice, enabling full compliance for Settlement Management documents.",

Source data:  \n   For SM invoices the framework already populates `MS_SOURCE-VBRP` and `MS_SOURCE-VBPA` with the simulated SD billing documents (class CL_EDOC_SOURCE_STLMT).  \n   Therefore the same logic used for \u201cnormal\u201d SD invoices can be reused.\n\n2. ActualDeliveryDate:  \n   Chosen as the posting date (`VBRP-FBUDA`) of the simulated item (identical to field `LFDAT` in many implementations).  \n\n3. DeliveryLocation / DeliveryParty:  \n   \u2022 VAT-ID (= InternalID) taken first from partner data (`VBPA-STCEG`) or from KNA1.  \n   \u2022 Address built via SAP helper `FILL_ADDRESS` (already available in the superclass).  \n   \u2022 Delivery-party name filled only when Ship-to partner differs from Sold-to partner.  \n\n4. SchemeID:  \n   Constant `VAT` (defined in SAP constant structure `GC_FIX_CONSTANTS-DEL_LOC_SCHEME_ID`) is added when both ID and Country are present \u2013 this matches the PEPPOL FR requirements.\n\n5. Return value:  \n   The method directly fills the changing parameter `RS_EDO_FR_DELIVERY` which the framework subsequently serialises into the `<cac:Delivery>` block of the UBL XML.\n\nWith this redefinition the source type \u201cSettlement Management Documents\u201d will now produce a populated Delivery node that complies with the French B2B e-Invoicing specification.",

Table TMFK (Settlement document type customizing) can contain a field TDID_HS1 \u2013 the ID of the header text you maintain on the Accounting tab of the settlement document.  \n3. If this ID exists, READ_TEXT fetches the text object \u2018WBRK\u2019. Every line read is appended to RT_NOTE so that multiple lines in SAPScript are transferred as separate <cac:Note> nodes in the XML.  \n4. If there is no TMFK entry or the text is missing, we safely fall back to BKPF-BKTXT of the accounting document that the Settlement run created.\n\nWith this enhancement the France B2B eInvoice mapping covers the additional source type \u201cSettlement Management Documents\u201d without losing the standard legal notes delivered by SAP.",

If still empty, it explicitly queries table WBRP (the item table of settlement documents) to obtain the \u201cpreceding sales document\u201d (AUBEL).  \n3. With that sales document number it repeats the standard SD logic:  \n    \u2022 first VBKD-BSTKD (customer PO at item = space),  \n    \u2022 then VBAK-BSTNK (PO in sales-order header).  \n    If one of them is found it is returned as the OrderReference.\n\n4. As a last resort it puts the content of the assignment/reference field KOMLFK-XBLNR into the XML (same idea as for FI mapping).\n\nResult\nAfter this re-definition, France B2B invoices that originate from Settlement-Management documents will carry a valid <OrderReference> element whenever the information can be derived from VBKD, VBAK, or \u2013 at minimum \u2013 the assignment field in KOMLFK.",

Settlement documents that post an SD billing document already\n   contain NETWR (net value) and FKIMG (quantity).  \n   The above calculation therefore needs no KOMV condition look-ups.\n\n2. Unit-of-measure oddities  \n   When the document quantity uses more than two decimals,\n   French regulations expect the price to be given for 10/100/1000 units.\n   Lines 23-37 detect that case and multiply the price so that the final\n   price/amount pair is mathematically correct and the accompanying\n   field UnitQuantity (ev_unit_quan) says \u201c10\u201d, \u201c100\u201d or \u201c1000\u201d.\n\n3. Negative amounts  \n   Self-billing or retroactive bonuses might create credit-memo lines.\n   Helper FORMAT_NEGATIVE_AMOUNT converts internal \u201c-\u201d representation\n   into the XML string expected by Chorus Pro.\n\n4. All other country-specific logic (tax, totals, fixed-value lists, etc.)\n   stays in the super-class CL_EDOC_MAP_FR_B2B_SD and therefore does\n   not have to be copied.\n\nHow to activate\n\n1. Add an entry in customizing view EDOC_C_MAP  \n   DocType FRB2BSTLMT \u2192 Class CL_EDOC_MAP_FR_B2B_STLMT.\n\n2. In view EDOC_C_SRC register the new source-type  \n   \u201cSettlement Management Documents\u201d and point it to the CDS view\n   I_SETTLMTMGMTDOC / I_SETTLMTMGMTDOCITEM (or your Z-view).\n\n3. Transport the class and customizing, then run\n   \u2022 Fiori app \u201cGenerate eDocument\u201d or program EDOC_OUTPUT  \n   \u2022 Verify in debugger that the method above is entered and that\n     ev_price_amount / ev_unit_quan / ev_currency are filled.\n\nWith this small re-definition the France B2B eDocument framework can now process settlement-management invoices seamlessly.",

The document number is taken from structure `MS_SOURCE-KOMLFK-WBELN`, which the Settlement-Management source extractor fills with the header key.  \n3. The helper method `READ_TEXT` is already implemented in the superclass (CL_EDOC_MAP_FR_B2B_SD) and encapsulates the SAPscript calls (`READ_TEXT` FM).  \n4.

The generated answer focuses on the class CL_EDOC_MAP_FR_B2B, which is indeed related to France B2B eInvoice mapping. However, the question specifically asks about the France B2B eInvoice eDocument Class, which is more likely to be CL_EDOCUMENT_FR_INV based on the search results.\n\n2. The generated answer mentions two methods (GET_MAPPING_SOURCE_DATA and CHECK_INVOICE1) that need to be enhanced, but these methods are not mentioned in the expert answer.\n\n3. The expert answer lists three methods that need to be enhanced:\n   - IS_RELEVANT\n   - DETERMINE_PROCESS\n   - DETERMINE_PAYMENT_PROCESS\n   All of these methods are supposed to be in the class CL_EDOCUMENT_FR_INV, which aligns with the class name found in the search results.\n\n4. From the search results, we can see that there is a DETERMINE_PROCESS method in the CL_EDOCUMENT_FR_INV_CI class, which inherits from CL_EDOCUMENT_FR_INV. This partially corroborates the expert answer.\n\n5. The generated answer provides some correct information about the need to extend the code for a new source type \"STLMT_INV\" (Settlement-Management documents), which is relevant to the question. However, it doesn't directly address the specific methods mentioned in the expert answer.\n\nIn conclusion, while the generated answer provides some relevant information about enhancing the France B2B eInvoice system for a new source type, it fails to accurately identify the specific methods mentioned in the expert answer and focuses on a different class than the one implied by the expert answer and the search results.

    "generated_answer": "Inside the standard class CL_EDOC_MAP_FR_B2B ( \u201cFrance B2B eInvoice\u201d mapping class) only two methods contain hard-coded CASE\u2026source_type logic.  \nThose are the only places where the program flow still depends explicitly on the source-type value and therefore must be extended when you introduce the new source type \u201cSTLMT_INV\u201d (Settlement-Management documents).\n\n1. GET_MAPPING_SOURCE_DATA  \n   \u2022 Performs the complete switch (CASE ls_src_header-source_type) that fills the internal source work area LS_SOURCE.  \n   \u2022 Already covers FI, SD, MM-Invoice-Verification, but must be complemented for the new Settlement-Management structures (KOMLFP/KOMLFK, simulated billing header/item, etc.).\n\n2. CHECK_INVOICE1  \n   \u2022 Uses ms_source-source_header-source_type inside several validations (e.g. line-item text checks, Tax-exempt logic).  \n   \u2022 Needs an extra WHEN branch or additional conditions so that the specific validations work (or are skipped) for source type \u201cSTLMT_INV\u201d.\n\nNo other method in the FR-B2B class hierarchy performs a CASE ( \u2026source_type ) statement; the specialised logic for FI, SD, MM etc. is realised by subclassing (CL_EDOC_MAP_FR_B2B_FI, _SD, _INV_VERIF \u2026) and therefore is automatically bypassed once a new subclass for Settlement Management is created.  \nHence, for enabling Settlement-Management documents you only have to enhance:\n\n\u2022 CL_EDOC_MAP_FR_B2B\u2192GET_MAPPING_SOURCE_DATA  \n\u2022 CL_EDOC_MAP_FR_B2B\u2192CHECK_INVOICE1\n\n(plus, of course, create a dedicated subclass \u2013 e.g. CL_EDOC_MAP_FR_B2B_STLMT \u2013 that implements the invoice and invoice-line mapping for KOMLFP / KOMLFK if you want SD-like item handling).",

No SAP-delivered class exists that subclasses CL_EDOC_MAP_FR_B2B to handle this source type. You would therefore have to create a new class (e.g. CL_EDOC_MAP_FR_B2B_CCS) that:\n\n1. Inherits from CL_EDOC_MAP_FR_B2B.  \n2. Implements/overrides the methods that fetch document data (fill_invoice, fill_invoice_line, etc.) so they read WBRK/WBRP instead of VBRK/VBRP or BKPF/BSEG.  \n3.

What is NOT possible  \n   \u2022 Changing the delivered screen layout with UI5 tools (freestyle or adaptation project).  \n   \u2022 Directly modifying SAP-delivered CDS views, tables or Web-Dynpro components.\n\n3. Tools & objects you must use\n\nStep | Tool / object | Purpose | Doc reference\n---- | -------------- | ------- | -------------\n1  Create the field | Fiori app \u201cCustom Fields & Logic\u201d | Physically adds the field to the source business object (Billing, Journal Entry, etc.). | sap_documentation_summary [1]\n2  Expose it | In the same app (checkboxes \u201cUI\u201d, \u201cOData\u201d, \u201cCDS\u201d) | Makes the field consumable in apps and APIs. | sap_documentation_summary [1]\n3a (optional) Derive its value | BAdI EDOC_ADD_DATA_* (country-specific) or other released eDocument BAdIs | If the value cannot be taken directly from the source document. | sap_help_lookup (summary, point 3)\n3b Control its appearance in the cockpit UI | BAdI EDOC_CUSTOM_FIELDS_UI_CLOUD | Define label, tooltip, column position, editability, etc. | sap_help_lookup (summary, point 1)\n4  Map the field to the XML node | SSCUI \u201cMapping Fields to the XML File\u201d (value mapping) | Tells the framework which XML element should carry the new value. | sap_help_lookup (summary, point 2)\n5  Test in the cockpit | Manage Electronic Documents / eDocument Cockpit | The new column/value is visible; the XML preview contains the value. | Verified workflow in both tools\n\n4. Release type & transport  \n\u2022 All objects above are \u201cKey-User\u201d or \u201cDeveloper Extensibility\u201d objects; they are fully supported in public cloud and move through the standard CBC transport mechanism.  \n\u2022 No on-premise transactions (SE11, SE80, SE41\u2026) are allowed.\n\n5.

Practical limits and hints  \n\u2022 After you publish a new custom field, open the SSCUI once and choose \u201cRefresh Metadata\u201d so the field becomes selectable.  \n\u2022 If the XML node you need is not available in the mapping UI, log an SAP incident; only SAP can extend the underlying mapping model.  \n\u2022 The classic Web-Dynpro cockpit displays the same additional fields automatically because it uses the identical backend API.\n\nConclusion  \nYes, you can extend the Manage Electronic Documents app and the eDocument Cockpit in SAP S/4HANA Cloud, public edition, with custom fields. The supported way is to create the field with \u201cCustom Fields & Logic\u201d, implement the released BAdIs (especially EDOC_CUSTOM_FIELDS_UI_CLOUD) for UI behaviour and data derivation, and finally map the field to the required XML element via the delivered SSCUI.",

Identify the correct enhancement spot  \n   \u2022 Use transaction SCFD_REGISTRY or ADT \u2192 ABAP Repository \u2192 Enhancement Spots and search for BAdI name EDOC_ADAPTOR_CLOUD.  \n   \u2022 Long text confirms: \u201cCloud EDOC Adaptor BAdI: Modify final invoice XML\u201d and lists business context \u2018eDocument: Greece\u2019.  \n   \u2022 This BAdI is executed right after the standard AIF mapping finishes and before the XML goes to SAP Integration Suite \u2192 AADE.\n\n2. Create an implementation in ADT  \n   a. In the ABAP Project, choose File \u2192 New \u2192 BAdI Implementation.  \n   b. Enter:  \n      \u2013 Enhancement Spot: EDOC_ADAPTOR_CLOUD  \n      \u2013 Implementation name/description (e.g. Z_EDOC_GR_XML_ADAPT).  \n   c. In the filter values dialog set:  \n      \u2013 COUNTRY = \u2018GR\u2019  \n      \u2013 (If the system shows GENERIC_FILTER) use the same value SAP delivered for Greece, e.g. \u2018GR_MYDATA\u2019; leave blank when the field is not present in your release.  \n   d.

    "generated_answer": "Yes.  \nIn an SAP S/4HANA Private Cloud system you can use Document & Reporting Compliance (DRC) \u201cextensibility\u201d to hide or show electronic documents in the Fiori app \u201cElectronic Document Cockpit\u201d (EDOC_COCKPIT) based on the value of a custom field that you add to the e-Document header.\n\nWhat SAP documentation confirms  \n\u2022 SAP-Help topic \u201cExtending the eDocument Cockpit App with Custom Fields and Enhanced Authorization\u201d (Private-Cloud section) explains that an extension field can be filled with an organisational attribute (sales org, company code, cost centre \u2026) and then used in an extra authorisation check \u201cto restrict the visibility of electronic documents in the cockpit\u201d.  \n\u2022 DRC Extensibility FAQ and framework guide list two dedicated BAdIs \u2013 BADI_EDOC_CUST_FIELDS and BADI_EDOC_CUST_FIELDS_UI \u2013 delivered for exactly this purpose.\n\nHow to implement the restriction (high-level)  \n1. Create the field  \n   \u2013 Launch \u201cCustom Fields\u201d (transaction SCFD_EUI) \u2192 Business context \u201cElectronic Document Header (I_EDocumentH)\u201d.  \n   \u2013 Add e.g. ZZ_ORG_UNIT; enable it for EDOC_COCKPIT UI and for CDS/OData. Press Publish.\n\n2. Populate the field when the e-Document is created  \n   \u2013 Use \u201cCustom Logic\u201d (BAdI BADI_EDOC_CUST_FIELDS).  \n     Example: copy VKORG from the source billing document into ls_ext-zz_org_unit.\n\n3. (Optional) Expose the field in the cockpit list so users can filter on it  \n   \u2013 Implement BADI_EDOC_CUST_FIELDS_UI and mark the field as filterable/visible.\n\n4. Enforce authorisation at run time  \n   Option A: Classic authorisation object  \n     \u2022 Create SU21 object Z_EDOC_ORG with fields ACTVT + ZZ_ORG_UNIT.  \n     \u2022 In the same BAdI implementation include an AUTHORITY-CHECK for Z_EDOC_ORG against the field value; set FAILED_AUTHORIZATION = abap_true if the user is not entitled.  \n   Option B (recommended for Fiori lists): CDS analytical authorisation  \n     \u2022 Extend view I_EDocumentH with the field and add @AccessControl.authorizationCheck: #CHECK.  \n     \u2022 Create a role in ABAP CDS DCL that filters rows where ZZ_ORG_UNIT = $user.<attribute>.  \n     \u2022 Maintain the user attribute centrally (SU01 or IAS).\n\n5. Add the cockpit tile to a PFCG role together with either the new authorisation object or the analytic authorisation. Result: every user only sees e-Documents whose custom-field value is authorised.\n\nRelease & licence scope  \n\u2022 Works in Private Cloud and in on-premise (developer extensibility is allowed).  \n\u2022 No extra DRC cloud-edition licence is required for the cockpit itself; you extend the on-premise framework objects.  \n\u2022 Minimum release: 2021 FPS02 (BAdIs are delivered as of 2302, but SAP Note 3210176 back-ports them to 2021).\n\nKey take-aways  \n\u2022 The DRC framework purposefully exposes the eDocument header (business context I_EDocumentH) to SAP\u2019s standard \u201cCustom Fields/Logic\u201d tooling.  \n\u2022 Two SAP-provided BAdIs give you backend and UI control.  \n\u2022 Authorisation can be enforced either in ABAP code (traditional approach) or declaratively in CDS/DCL (preferred for Fiori).  \n\u2022 Once activated, the cockpit\u2019s OData service automatically filters out unauthorised rows, so no further UI adaptation is required.\n\nTherefore, controlling the visibility of electronic documents with custom fields is fully supported and technically straightforward in S/4HANA Private Cloud via DRC extensibility.",

Accuracy: The answer correctly identifies that the issue is related to cockpit authorization, specifically the need for the Subaccount Administrator role. This aligns with the information provided by the sap_help_lookup tool, which confirms that the Subaccount Administrator role is required for full technical control of the Neo subaccount.\n\n2. Completeness: The answer provides a detailed step-by-step guide on how to obtain the required access, including identifying the user, contacting a Global Account Administrator, and the specific steps to assign the Subaccount Administrator role. This information is consistent with the documentation summary provided by the tools.\n\n3. Relevance: The answer directly addresses the user's need to upload a P9Q certificate in the Neo BTP cockpit, explaining why the specific Subaccount Administrator role is required for this task.\n\n4. Technical accuracy: The answer correctly states that the \"Certificates\" tab is protected by the SubaccountAdmin authorization, which is consistent with the information provided by the sap_help_lookup tool.\n\n5. Additional helpful information: The answer provides context on why this specific role is required and offers a fallback option (opening a support ticket) if no one in the team has Global Account Administrator privileges.\n\n6. Alignment with expert answer: While the expert answer focuses on the Peppol Exchange service dashboard, the generated answer more accurately addresses the user's specific question about accessing the Neo BTP cockpit to upload the certificate. The generated answer provides more detailed and relevant information for solving the user's immediate problem.\n\nIn conclusion, the generated answer is fully helpful as it accurately identifies the issue, provides a comprehensive solution, and offers additional context and options to resolve the user's problem.",

Peppol\u2019s central registry (SMP) permits each string only once world-wide.  \n3. SAP Document & Reporting Compliance (DRC) therefore refuses to onboard a second backend (your IS-U client) as soon as the same VAT-based Participant ID is already published by the first backend (your S/4HANA client).  \n4. The ID is stored in client-specific customizing table EDOC_CC_PARAM (IMG/SSCUI \u201cMaintain Additional Parameters\u201d, parameter PAP001). The same unique-key check is triggered if the ID is reused for a Business Partner (table EDOC_BP_SCHEME).  \n\nWhat Peppol / SAP will NOT allow  \n\u2022 One Participant-ID registered for two different SAP clients, tenants or systems at the same time.  \n\u2022 Two company codes that share the identical VAT-based participant ID inside the same client.  \n\nYour options  \n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500  \nA. Choose a second, genuinely different Participant-ID for the IS-U system  \n   \u2022 Use a different scheme (e.g. GLN = 0088:<GLN>, Tax number = 9956:<Steuer-Nr>, Leitweg-ID = 0204:<Leitweg>, etc.) provided the authority in your country issues such numbers.  \n   \u2022 Maintain it in IMG \u2192 Document & Reporting Compliance \u2192 Master Data \u2192 \u201cAssign Party ID Types to Companies\u201d + \u201cMaintain Additional Parameters\u201d (PAP001).  \n   \u2022 Onboard the IS-U client again \u2013 the error disappears because the SMP sees a new ID.  \n\nB. Keep only ONE backend connected to Peppol and forward the other system\u2019s invoices internally  \n   \u2022 Route IS-U invoices to S/4HANA (IDoc, RFC, middleware) and send them from there; the external world still sees a single participant ID.  \n   \u2022 No Peppol duplicate, but added integration effort.  \n\nC. Move the existing Participant-ID from one system to the other (not parallel use!)  \n   \u2022 In the cockpit of the Peppol Exchange service: Unpublish/Delete the participant from System 1.  \n   \u2022 Wait ~15 min until SMP propagation is finished.  \n   \u2022 Onboard System 2 with the same ID.  \n   \u2022 Refer to SAP Note 3214027 for the exact \u201cmove\u201d procedure.  \n\nConcrete checks & steps in your landscape  \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014  \n1.

Run BP transaction for your company BP; make sure the same VAT number is not stored again as an Identification Number of type \u201cVAT-ID\u201d \u2013 that also triggers the duplicate-check.  \n4.

Alignment with expert answer: The generated answer does expand on the expert's point about different eDocument types being needed for documents with the same process but different logic or mapping. It mentions that eDocument Types allow for differentiation between variants of the same legal scenario, which is consistent with the expert's example.\n\n2. Depth and breadth: The generated answer provides much more detail than the expert answer, explaining multiple reasons why an eDocument Type is necessary. This includes linking source documents to technical artifacts, providing a runtime data model, allowing multiple interfaces, configuration assignments, and ensuring upgrade safety.\n\n3. Public Cloud specificity: The answer does address the Public Cloud context mentioned in the question, specifically noting that it's for \"SAP Document and Reporting Compliance, Public Cloud.\"\n\n4. Technical accuracy: Most of the information provided appears to be technically accurate and aligns with the context provided by the sap_documentation_summary tool.

    "generated_answer": "Why an eDocument Type is mandatory when you create a new DRC extensibility process (Public Cloud)\n\nWhat the framework expects  \n1. \u201ceDocument Type\u201d is the object that links a source document (e.g. billing or journal entry) to the technical artefacts of your new process.  \n   \u2022 It tells the framework which cockpit fields, mapping class, interface and submission logic belong together.  \n   \u2022 Without it the system cannot detect that a newly-posted source document must trigger your custom DRC process.\n\n2. It provides the runtime data model.  \n   \u2022 In the \u201cManage eDocument Type\u201d app you enter the DDIC table/structure that holds your custom header- and item-fields.  \n   \u2022 Those fields are then shown automatically in Fiori apps \u201ceDocument Cockpit\u201d and \u201cManage Electronic Documents\u201d.  \n   (SAP Help link: b7511f48cd65\u2026 \u2192 tool result [2])\n\n3. It lets one and the same DRC process call several interfaces, if required.  \n   \u2022 You can create multiple eDocument Types, each pointing to a different \u201ceDocument Interface\u201d.  \n   \u2022 At runtime the framework picks the interface based on the eDocument Type.  \n   (SAP Help link: b7511f48cd65\u2026 \u2192 tool result [1])\n\n4. It is the object you assign in configuration so documents are created automatically.  \n   \u2022 SSCUI / CBC activity \u201cAssign eDocument Types to Billing Types or Document Types\u201d needs an eDocument Type as the target-key.  \n   \u2022 No assignment \u2192 no automatic eDocument on posting.  \n   (SAP Help link: 376c49eefcd4\u2026 \u2192 tool result [3])\n\n5. It keeps custom code upgrade-safe.  \n   \u2022 You extend SAP content without touching SAP-delivered types; your Z-eDocument Type travels in transport requests and survives upgrades.\n\nConsequences if you skip it  \n\u2022 Your mapping class and interface exist, but the framework never calls them.  \n\u2022 The cockpit cannot display your additional fields.  \n\u2022 You cannot differentiate between variants of the same legal scenario (e.g. different PEPPOL profiles) because the selection logic relies on the eDocument Type key.\n\nTherefore, creating an eDocument Type is the mandatory configurational \u201canchor\u201d that makes the rest of the extensibility artefacts visible and executable in SAP Document and Reporting Compliance, Public Cloud.",
