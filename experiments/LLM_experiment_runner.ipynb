         "To attach additional files to the standard XML in Public Cloud, you can use the Business Add-In (BAdI) EDOC_ADAPTOR_CLOUD and enhance the XML file generated for an electronic document.\nBy enhancing the XML file, you can include additional information that may be relevant for your business processes .\nTo implement this enhancement, you can follow these steps in ABAP Development Tools (ADT):\n1. In your ABAP project, go to the enhancement spot ES_EDOCUMENT_CLOUD and select 'New BAdI Enhancement Implementation'.\n2. Enter a package, name, and description for the implementation.\n3. Choose 'Add BAdI Implementation' and select EDOC_ADAPTOR_CLOUD .\n4. (Optional) Create a BAdI filter for Country and/or Generic Filter.\n5.

         "In SAP S/4HANA Public Cloud the XML that SAP delivers for a standard output (invoice, purchase order, e-invoice, etc.) is part of the “released” scope.  \nBecause of this it cannot be modified or enriched inside the ERP tenant itself – neither by key-user extensibility nor by a BAdI implementation (the few BAdIs that exist for on-premise are not released in the public-cloud scope).  \nSo there are only two supported ways to add “extra files” to what is sent out:\n\n1. Attach the file to the business document and let Output Management add it as a\n   separate e-mail attachment.  \n   • Open the document in the Fiori app (e.g. Create Billing Documents, Manage Sales Orders).  \n   • Go to the “Attachments” facet (paper-clip).  \n   • Upload the file.  \n   • Make sure the output type you use is configured with the flag\n     “Print PDF Attachments / Send Attachments” in Output Parameter\n     Determination (App “Output Parameter Determination” → tab “Email Settings”).  \n   • Result: the standard XML (or its rendered PDF) is sent exactly as delivered by SAP,\n     and the additional file travels with the e-mail as a separate MIME part.  \n   • If you need to do this by API instead of the UI, call\n     service API_CV_ATTACHMENT_SRV (or A_ATTACHMENT_API_SRV) to upload the binary\n     to the document; Output Management will pick it up in the same way.\n\n2. Add the file in the middleware, not in the XML.  \n   • Let the ERP system emit the XML unchanged.  \n   • In SAP Integration Suite / CPI (or any other middleware) build an iFlow that  \n        – receives the XML message,  \n        – queries the S/4HANA “Attachment” service in a secondary call if the file is\n          stored there, **or** reads the file from another source,  \n        – puts the XML and the extra file together in a multipart/mixed, multipart/related,\n          ZIP or any format your partner requires,  \n        – forwards the package to the final receiver.  \n   • This approach keeps the ERP core clean and still fulfils the partner-specific\n     requirement of “one payload that also contains X, Y, Z”.\n\nWhat you cannot do in Public Cloud\n• Add a new node or a Base64-encoded binary object directly inside the standard XML\n  structure (e.g. an <AdditionalDocumentReference> with an embedded binary) –\n  the XML schema is locked by SAP.  \n• Implement on-prem BAdIs such as EDOC_ADDITIONAL_INFORMATION_IF or\n  SD_BIL_OUTPUT_PDF – they are not released in SAP S/4HANA Cloud.  \n• Modify the Adobe form interface to carry a second binary stream.\n\nTherefore:  \n– If the receiver of the message is happy with “XML + separate attachment”, use\n  the attachment facet / API and the e-mail option.  \n– If the receiver insists on “files embedded in the same technical message”, wrap\n  them in CPI (or another integration layer) after the XML leaves S/4HANA Cloud.",

         "In the public-cloud edition of SAP S/4HANA the only supported way to touch the XML that the Greece e-Document solution (SAP Document & Reporting Compliance – Greece) sends to ΑΑΔΕ is to implement the released cloud BAdI that is called immediately after SAP has built the XML but before it is handed over to the communication framework.  \nThe work is therefore done in “developer extensibility” (ADT, not in the key-user browser tools).  \nThe complete procedure is outlined below.\n\n1. Prepare and collect data to be added\n   • Identify the additional tags / attributes that must be inserted (for example Project Code, Vehicle Plate Number, internal Reference etc.).  \n   • Make sure the data are available on the source business object (billing document, FI invoice …). If not, create the needed custom fields first in the app “Custom Fields and Logic” and expose them to\n     – Business Context: Customer Invoice / Supplier Invoice (as needed) and\n     – Business Context: Electronic Document Greece.  \n     Publish the fields – this automatically extends the EDOC database tables.\n\n2. Log on to the tenant from ADT (Eclipse)\n   • Install the ABAP Development Tools plug-in (if not already done).  \n   • File → New → ABAP Cloud Project, log on to your S/4HANA Cloud system with a user that has role SAP_BR_DEVELOPER.  \n   • Create (or reuse) a local customer package in your customer namespace (e.g. ZEDOC_GR).\n\n3. Create the BAdI implementation\n   • In the project choose : New → ABAP Repository Object → Enhancement Implementation → Business Add-In (BAdI).  \n   • Search for the released BAdI “EDOC_GR_XML_ENHANCE” (technical name: IF_EDOC_GR_XML_ENHANCE, Enhancement Spot: EDOC_ENHANCEMENT_SPOT)*.  \n   • Give the implementation a name (e.g. Z_I_EDOC_GR_XML), description, transport request and package.\n\n4. Implement the enhancement method\n   • Double-click the generated class and implement method\n         IF_EDOC_GR_XML_ENHANCE~ENHANCE_XML\n     Signatures (simplified):\n         IMPORTING  i_electronic_document TYPE if_edoc_electronic_document=>ty_s_electronic_document\n         CHANGING   c_xml                TYPE xstring.  \n   • Typical coding pattern:\n\n     DATA: lt_xml TYPE TABLE OF string,\n           lv_xml TYPE string.\n\n     \"Convert XSTRING to string / internal table, or use an XML DOM\n     cl_sxml_string_reader=>create( )->next_node( … ).\n\n     \"Insert new node / attribute\n     … read required custom fields from i_electronic_document->extension\n     … modify the DOM / string accordingly …\n\n     \"Convert back to XSTRING\n     c_xml = cl_sxml_string_writer=>create( … )->get_output( ).\n\n   • Only released ABAP APIs may be used; no direct database SELECTs are allowed.  \n   • Save and activate class and BAdI implementation.\n\n5. Test the enhancement\n   • Create or simulate an invoice that triggers the Greece e-Document.  \n   • Go to app “eDocument Cockpit” (or “Document & Reporting Compliance – Greece”) and check the generated document.  \n   • Use “Preview XML” – the additional tags should now be visible.  \n   • Send the document; the same XML is transferred to ΑΑΔΕ.\n\n6. Transport & lifecycle\n   • Because you worked in a customer transportable package, the implementation follows the standard Cloud transport procedure (Export Software Collection → Import in Q-/P-system).  \n   • Remember to retest after every SAP upgrade because SAP may deliver a new XML schema version; the BAdI keeps its place in the processing chain, but your code must still produce valid XML.\n\n(* BAdI name taken from the current S/4HANA Cloud release. If your tenant shows a slightly different technical name, select the one that is marked “ released ” for Greece XML enhancement – there is only one.)\n\nResult  \nBy implementing EDOC_GR_XML_ENHANCE in ADT you have an SAP-supported, upgrade-safe spot where you can add or change any part of the Greece XML just before it is sent to the tax authorities.",

         "Short answer: No – in SAP S/4HANA Cloud, public edition, the standard Fiori applications “Manage Electronic Documents” (F1721) and its predecessor “eDocument Cockpit” are not released for key-user or developer extensibility, therefore you cannot add your own custom field to the UI or to the underlying monitor tables/services.\n\nWhy?\n\n1. No released business context  \n   The app is fed by the CDS view I_EDOCMONITOR (and the corresponding OData service).  \n   This business context is not whitelisted in “Custom Fields & Logic”, so you cannot create a custom field and have SAP add it automatically to the monitor structure.\n\n2. No UI-adaptation extension points  \n   For many list-report apps you can use “Adapt UI” to add an existing, *already delivered* field.  \n   The cockpit/monitor does not offer an extension column nor a flexible column layout that would allow you to bind a new field.\n\n3. No developer extensibility in public cloud  \n   In on-premise / private-cloud you could implement BAdIs such as EDOC_COCKPIT_ATTR or enhance the CDS view and rebuild the Fiori element.  \n   ABAP developer extensibility of that type is not available in the public-cloud edition.\n\nWhat is still possible?\n\n• You can fill or repurpose the *existing* free-text fields (e.g. Reference Document Number, Note) by means of the released BAdIs that build the eDocument payload.  \n• You can extend the XML/JSON payload that is sent to the authority by using the mapping-extension BAdIs – but that information will not appear as an extra column in the monitor.  \n• If you really need a list report that shows your own field, you must build a separate custom Fiori application on top of the released A2X API “Electronic Document – Read” (API_EDOC_*) and publish it under your own tile; the standard monitor itself cannot be changed.\n\nTherefore, in the public-cloud system you cannot “extend the Manage Electronic Documents app / eDocument Cockpit app by adding a custom field”; you would have to live with the standard fields or create a standalone custom app that consumes the same eDocument data.",

Preparation\n------------------------------------\n1.1 Find the eDocument process you are going to extend  \n     App: Manage Electronic Documents  ➔ open any document of the process and note\n        • Process name   (e.g. MX_EINV, PEPPOL_BILLING …)  \n        • Document type  (e.g. ‘FPEL’ ‘INV’ …)\n\n1.2 Check whether the field already exists  \n     App: Manage Mapping for eDocument ➔ Display the mapping tree\n     If the field is already available in the Source structure you only need step 5\n     (mapping) – all other steps can be skipped.\n\n------------------------------------\n2. Create the field in the business object\n------------------------------------\n2.1 “Key user” step – Custom Fields App  \n     • Business context that holds the data you need (e.g. SD Billing Document Header).  \n     • Add your field (YY1_ZPRCTR for example, data element CHAR10).  \n     • Mark “Enable Usage” –> Electronic Document and (if required) APIs, CDS.  \n     • Publish.\n\nResult: the field is appended to the relevant database include\n        and to the released CDS view I_BillingDocument*.\n\n------------------------------------\n3. Expose the field in the eDocument extraction CDS view\n------------------------------------\nDone in ADT (Developer Extensibility)\n\n3.1 Create a CDS view extension “yy1_edoc_billing_ext”:\n\n  @EndUserText.label : 'Extension – add ZPRCTR to I_Edoc_Billing'\n  extend view I_Edoc_Billing\n    with yy1_edoc_billing_ext\n  {\n     _BillingDocument.YY1_ZPRCTR as CustProfitCtr\n  }\n\n• Only projection-list extensions are allowed in public cloud.  \n• Activate – the field is now technically part of the eDocument\n  extraction structure (is_all_edoc_data).\n\n------------------------------------\n4. Fill the field (if the standard extractor does not do it)\n------------------------------------\n4.1 Create a BAdI implementation in ADT  \n     Enhancement spot: ES_EDOC_SUPPLEMENT  \n     BAdI definition:      BADI_EDOC_SUPPLEMENT           (released)  \n     Interface delivered:  IF_EDOC_SUPPLEMENT\n\n4.2 Sample implementation class\n\nCLASS zcl_edoc_supp_profitctr\n  DEFINITION PUBLIC FINAL\n  CREATE PUBLIC.\n\n  PUBLIC SECTION.\n    INTERFACES if_badi_interface.\n    INTERFACES if_edoc_supplement.\nENDCLASS.\n\n\nCLASS zcl_edoc_supp_profitctr IMPLEMENTATION.\n  METHOD if_edoc_supplement~get_additional_data.\n* ”edoc_header” is the data that will be written to EDOC_DOCUMENT\n    LOOP AT ct_edoc_header ASSIGNING FIELD-SYMBOL(<ls_header>).\n      READ TABLE it_vbrk ASSIGNING FIELD-SYMBOL(<ls_vbrk>)\n           WITH KEY vbeln = <ls_header>-billingdocument.\n      IF sy-subrc = 0.\n        <ls_header>-custprofitctr = <ls_vbrk>-yy1_zprctr.\n      ENDIF.\n    ENDLOOP.\n  ENDMETHOD.\nENDCLASS.\n\n4.3 Publish the implementation (ADT context menu → Release for key user)\n\n------------------------------------\n5. Map the field into the outbound payload\n------------------------------------\n5.1 App: Manage Mapping for eDocument\n     • Copy SAP delivered mapping → create your version (Draft → Active).  \n     • In the Source tree you now see CustProfitCtr.  \n     • Drag the field to the position in the Target tree where the local\n       authority expects it, or add a new element.  \n     • Save and Activate the mapping version.\n\n------------------------------------\n6. Test\n------------------------------------\n6.1 Create / change a billing document (or source object) such that the new\n     field has a value.  \n6.2 Run “Create eDocument” / schedule the extraction job.  \n6.3 In Manage Electronic Documents display the JSON/XML content → your field\n     must appear with the correct value.  \n6.4 Send the document; check that the interface to the Peppol Service /\n     E-Invoice Service etc. remains green.\n\n------------------------------------\n7. Transport / Lifecycle\n------------------------------------\n• Objects created in ADT belong to the cloud transport layer ZLOCAL.  \n  They are moved with the “Export Software Collection” app.  \n• Mapping changes are collected in the same software collection.  \n• Key-user custom field is also transported that way.\n\n-------------------------------------------------\nImportant Hints / Troubleshooting\n-------------------------------------------------\n• A CDS view extension is the ONLY possibility to add fields to the\n  extraction structure in public cloud – append structures at DDIC\n  level are not allowed.  \n• Do not change SAP delivered CDS view keys or annotations.  \n• Every field that shall be mapped must be contained in table\n  IS_ALL_EDOC_DATA (view I_EDOC_ALL); otherwise it is ignored.  \n• If you do not see your field in the mapping tool, clear the metadata\n  cache in “Manage Mapping for eDocument” (button ‘Regenerate Source’).  \n• Unit tests: use ABAP Unit in your BAdI class or the Test functionality\n  in “Manage Electronic Documents” (simulate extraction only).\n\nBy following the seven steps above you have technically extended the\nstandard eDocument process, populated the new field with business data,\nmade it available in the mapping UI and finally sent it to the external\nauthority – completely supported in SAP S/4HANA Public Cloud and without\nmodifying any SAP artefact.",

If the user removes the filter he will still see all documents that the standard authorisation objects allow.\n\n• If you really have to restrict by a custom field …  \n  – You would have to build your own authorisation check:  \n    – create a new Z-authorisation object,  \n    – implement a BAdI/implicit enhancement or a CDS DCL that calls this object, and  \n    – copy/extend the OData service (and maybe the Fiori app) so that the check is executed during the read.  \n  – That is a custom development; SAP does not provide it.\n\nSo, out-of-the-box you can only restrict visibility with the standard eDocument authorisation objects (company code, scenario, etc.).

         "In SAP S/4HANA Cloud, public edition, you cannot “switch-off” the creation buttons inside the UI with customizing; you have to work with authorizations.  \nThe whole eDocument cockpit (Manage Electronic Documents / eDocument Cockpit) is delivered through two different business catalogues:\n\n• SAP_FIN_BC_EDOC_PROC_PC    – Electronic Document Processing (FULL = create, change, send, cancel, etc.)  \n• SAP_FIN_BC_EDOC_DISP_PC    – Electronic Document Display (READ-ONLY)\n\nTherefore, the way to prevent users from creating an eDocument is simply to give them only the display catalogue.  \nBelow is the complete procedure that has to be carried out in Spain (it is identical for every country solution, e.g. SII, TicketBAI, etc.).\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\nImplementation steps\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1. Identify who still needs to work with the cockpit  \n   • Users that are allowed to create / resend / cancel eDocuments keep the processing role.  \n   • Everybody else should receive a display-only role.\n\n2. Create a display-only business role\n\n   a) Open the Fiori app “Maintain Business Roles”.  \n   b) Copy the standard role template   \n      SAP_BR_EDOC_PROCESS_PC (or any Z-role you are already using).  \n   c) In the copy, delete the processing catalogue\n      ➔ remove SAP_FIN_BC_EDOC_PROC_PC.  \n   d) Add the display catalogue\n      ➔ add SAP_FIN_BC_EDOC_DISP_PC.  \n   e) Save and generate the new role, for example ZBR_EDOC_DISPLAY.\n\n   Result  \n   – The tile “Manage Electronic Documents” (F4825) is still available,  \n   – But all actions that need the POST, PUT or DELETE OData verbs (Create, Change, Cancel, Send) are removed automatically; the user can only display documents.\n\n3. Assign the new role to the required users\n\n   a) In “Maintain Business Roles”, use the “Maintain Restrictions” button if you would like to restrict further (company code, plant, etc.).  \n   b) Use “Maintain Business Users” (or Import Users CSV) to attach ZBR_EDOC_DISPLAY to the identified employees.\n\n4. (Optional) Hide the processing tiles altogether  \n   If you do not even want the tile to be displayed, do one of the following:\n   • In “Manage Launchpad Pages” remove the card “Manage Electronic Documents” from the user’s page and add “Display Electronic Documents” (F4852) instead.  \n   • Or keep the page but set it to “No Display” in the page or section settings.\n\n5. Transport to Q-system and P-system  \n   Use “Export Software Collection” → “Import Collection” so the new role reaches the productive tenant.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\nAdditional configuration possibilities (if you want the system itself to stop building eDocuments)\n\nThe authorization restriction explained above is usually sufficient; however, for Spain you can also stop automatic generation for specific document types or company codes:\n\n• SSCUI 103075 “Define Document Types Relevant for SII”\n  – Remove the relevance flag for the FI or SD document types you do not want to report.\n\n• SSCUI 103077 “Define Relevance of Company Codes and Document Types”\n  – Mark a combination as “Not relevant”.  \n  – The posting will be saved in FI/SD, but the eDocument is never generated, so nothing will appear in the cockpit.\n\n• Output Parameter Determination – Billing Document (SSCUI 101024)\n  – In the CHANNEL determination step, make sure the condition does NOT return EDOC; then no eDocument output is triggered from billing.\n\nThose SSCUIs influence document creation system-wide, not only per user; therefore, use them only if you really must block the entire company code or document type.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\nResult for the Spanish public-cloud customer\n\nAfter the steps above, users who only have the display catalogue can do the following inside the cockpit:\n\n✓ Search electronic documents  \n✓ View header / item data  \n✓ Monitor processing status and error messages  \n✗ They cannot press “Create”, “Send”, “Cancel”, “Resend”, “Re-process”, “Change”, etc.\n\nHence the creation of an eDocument is effectively restricted without touching code or carrying out any non-cloud-compliant modification.",

Activate and publish (transport) the implementation.\n\nWhat the parameters mean\n\n• IV_OBJECT         – technical object that triggered the eDocument (BKPF, RBKP …).  \n• IS_HEADER_DATA    – union of the most important header fields (company code, currency, net amount, …).  \n• IT_ITEM_DATA      – internal table with line-item data (tax codes, material numbers, …).  \n• C_IS_RELEVANT     – export flag that you set to abap_true ( ‘X’ ) if a document shall reach the eDocument Cockpit; leave it initial to suppress creation.\n\nWith this tiny adapter you can switch eDocument generation on or off with a few lines of ABAP logic instead of touching the standard mapping or customizing. Adapt or remove checks as required for your own business rules.",

Decide what you need to add  \n   • List the tags/attributes that are missing in the XML.  \n   • Identify in which application object the data is stored (billing document, journal entry, etc.).\n\n2. Create the field(s) – app “Custom Fields and Logic”  \n   • Tab “Custom Fields” → Create → choose the business context that contains the data (e.g. “Sales: Billing Document – Header”, “Finance: Journal Entry – Item”).  \n   • Maintain data type, label, length.  \n   • In section “Services” (or “OData/Service Adaptation” depending on release) tick the usage “Document Compliance – Electronic Document”.  \n   • Publish the field.  \n     Result: the field is automatically appended to the e-Document staging CDS view (EDOC_C_****).\n\n3. Expose the field to the eDocument mapping tables (one-time step)  \n   • Open “Manage Your Solution” → Configure Your Solution (SSCUI).  \n   • Finance → Document Compliance → “Map Additional Fields for Electronic Documents” (technical SSCUI 103206 – name may vary).  \n   • Map the custom field that you created to one of the free customer fields (CUST_FIELD_01-10) on HEADER and/or ITEM level.  \n   • Save.\n\n4. Write the value to the XML – app “Custom Fields and Logic”, tab “Custom Logic”  \n   • Create implementation for the BAdI that SAP ships for Greek XML enrichment.  \n     – Outgoing (billing) invoices: spot EDOC_XML_ENRICHMENT_GRC_AR (exact name can be checked in the drop-down).  \n     – Incoming (AP self-billing): spot EDOC_XML_ENRICHMENT_GRC_AP (if used).  \n   • Sample skeleton code (AR):  \n\n     METHOD if_edoc_xml_enrichment~enrich_xml.  \n       DATA ls_value TYPE string.  \n\n       \"Read the value you mapped in step 3  \n       ls_value = is_document_data-header-cust_field_01.  \n\n       IF ls_value IS NOT INITIAL.  \n         \"Add a new element to the XML – helper class supplied by SAP  \n         cl_edoc_xml_helper=>add_child(  \n              EXPORTING  \n                io_parent    = io_xml_root         \"root node  \n                iv_name      = 'MyExtraTag'         \"tag name  \n                iv_namespace = co_ns_grc            \"namespace constant delivered by SAP  \n                iv_value     = ls_value ).  \n       ENDIF.  \n     ENDMETHOD.\n\n   • Publish the logic.\n\n5.

Transport to Production  \n   • In the “Export Software Collection” app add:  \n     ‑ the custom field,  \n     ‑ the BAdI implementation,  \n     ‑ the mapping (SSCUI activity).  \n   • Release the collection and import it in the P-system.\n\nImportant notes / restrictions for Public Cloud customers:  \n• You must stay inside the structure that SAP officially delivers for Greece; you may add custom child elements, but you may not change the names or sequence of the standard nodes.  \n• If the Greek authority changes the XSD itself, raise an SAP incident on component FI-LOC-GR-DC; SAP must deliver the structural change.  \n• All enhancements have to be done with the key-user tools shown above; classic SE80, SE24 etc. do not exist in Public Cloud.\n\nBy following the six steps above you can safely enhance the XML that is generated by the Manage Electronic Document app (Fiori) or the eDocument Cockpit without breaking the public-cloud restrictions.",

         "In SAP S/4HANA Cloud (public edition) the e-mail that is generated when you press “Send” in the Manage Electronic Documents app is built by the Output-Management framework.  \nYou can only influence it through the tools that are released for in-app extensibility; classic source-code modifications are not possible in the public cloud.\n\nTo enrich or completely redesign the mail, proceed in two steps:\n\n────────────────────────────────────────  \n1. Create / change the e-mail template  \n────────────────────────────────────────  \na. Open the Fiori app “Maintain E-Mail Templates”.  \nb. Find the template that SAP delivers for the German e-invoice scenario (for example\n   EDOC_DE_INV_MAIL or a similar name; the exact ID depends on your release).  \nc. Copy it → give the copy a Z/Y name.  \nd. Edit Subject and Body (HTML or Plain Text).  \n   • You can insert the standard placeholders that are offered in the right-hand pane.  \n   • Everything that is not available as a placeholder can later be filled in a BAdI (see step 2).  \ne. Save and Activate the template.\n\nf. Assign your new template to the output determination rules  \n   – App “Output Parameter Determination”  \n   – Application = Electronic Document (country DE)  \n   – Step “E-Mail”  \n   – Field “E-Mail Template” = your Z template.  \n   Publish the rule.\n\nFrom now on the framework will already use your own subject/body whenever a German e-invoice is sent.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────  \n2. Add additional logic (optional) with a released BAdI  \n────────────────────────────────────────  \nIf you need information that is not available as a normal placeholder (e.g. customer-specific texts, additional recipients, conditional subject lines) implement the in-app BAdI:\n\n• Fiori app “Custom Logic”  \n• Business Context  : Electronic Document – E-Mail Output Parameters  \n• BAdI Name         : EDOC_OUTPUT_EMAIL (exact name may vary slightly; description\n                       “Change E-Mail Settings for Electronic Document Output”)  \n• Create your implementation and code, for example:\n\nMETHOD change_email_settings.  \n\n  \"Fill additional dynamic parts in subject/body\"\n  DATA(lv_name) = edoc_bp_data-name1.\n  email_settings-subject =\n      |Ihre Rechnung { edoc_header-ref_doc_no }|.\n\n  email_settings-body =\n      |Sehr geehrte/r { lv_name },<br><br>| &&\n      |anbei erhalten Sie Ihre Rechnung { edoc_header-ref_doc_no } im XML- und PDF-Format.| &&\n      |<br><br>Freundliche Grüße<br>Ihr Unternehmen|.\n\n  \"Add another recipient, if required\"\n  APPEND VALUE #( email = 'info@mycompany.de' ) TO email_settings-recipients_to.\n\nENDMETHOD.\n\n• Save, check, and Publish the logic.\n\nEvery time the framework prepares the e-mail (background job or online), it calls your BAdI implementation first, then merges the result with the template you created in step 1, and finally sends the mail with the attachments (XML + PDF).\n\n────────────────────────────────────────  \nResult  \n────────────────────────────────────────  \n• Maintenance stays 100 % inside the public-cloud toolset (no SAP-GUI, no modifications).  \n• Business users can further adjust text in the template app without touching the BAdI.  \n• Developers can enrich the mail with any data that is accessible in the e-document\n  header/item structures.",

Find the object that sends the mail\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nApp “Output Parameter Determination”  \n– Application Area: FINEDOC – Document Compliance  \n– Determination Step: Output Types  \nHere you will usually see the standard output type EDOC_EMAIL (or country-specific one, e.g. MX_EDOC_EMAIL).  \nThe form template that is assigned to that output type is the e-mail template that is used.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n2. Copy the standard e-mail template\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nApp “Maintain E-Mail Templates” (F1814)  \n– Search for the template that is assigned in step 1 (for most countries it is FIN_EDOC_EMAIL or FIN_EDOC_EMAIL_<country>).  \n– Press “Copy”, give your own Z* (customer) ID and description.  \n– Change Subject and HTML/Text part as you like.  \n  • Press “Show Available Placeholders” to insert variables that the eDocument interface already provides (e.g. ${DocumentNumber}, ${CustomerName}, ${NetAmount}).  \n  • You can switch between HTML and Plain-Text tab.  \n– Activate / Publish.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n3. (Optional) Add additional data as placeholders\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nIf the field you want to show is not offered:  \n\na. App “Custom Fields and Logic”  \n   – Create a custom field with business context “Financial Document Compliance – eDocument Header/Item”  \n   – Publish the field.  \n\nb. App “Data Source Extensions”  \n   – Extend the data source FIN_EDOC_OUTPUT (or country-specific one) with the new field.  \n   – Publish.\n\nNow the new field appears in “Maintain E-Mail Templates” as an additional placeholder.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n4. Adapt the PDF / XML attachment (if required)\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n• PDF: App “Maintain Form Templates” – copy the Adobe form that is attached to the same output type, adapt it in Adobe LiveCycle Designer, upload the new version, activate.  \n• XML: cannot be changed; it is the legal XML delivered by SAP (for tax authorities).\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n5. Assign the new template to the output type\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nApp “Output Parameter Determination”  \n– Application Area FINEDOC, Document EDOC  \n– Determination Step: Output Types  \n   • Choose rule for output type EDOC_EMAIL  \n   • In column “Form Template” enter your Z-template ID (or maintain a new line with conditions Customer / Country / Company Code etc.).  \n– Save.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n6. Transport the configuration\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nIn CBC / Q2P transport your email-template object R3TR FORM and the OPD customizing.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n7. Test\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n• Create or simulate an electronic document in “Manage Electronic Documents”.  \n• Choose “Send to Customer” (or the country-specific function).  \n• Open the application log or check your mail inbox – the new mail layout / PDF should be used.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nWhat you cannot do\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n• Change the sender address logic (comes from Output-Management Communication Arrangement).  \n• Add your own ABAP coding – no enhancement spot is released for this scenario in Public Cloud.  \n• Change the mail sending program to add CC/BCC dynamically – only the fields offered in OPD are possible.\n\nWith the steps above you can freely design the text, subject, pictures, additional placeholders, and even attach your own PDF layout while staying completely inside the standard, upgrade-safe capabilities of SAP S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition.",

         "In an SAP S/4HANA Public-Cloud system you create an electronic-document scenario completely in the Electronic Document Processing (EDP) framework.  \nBecause you are in the Public Cloud all work has to be done with CBC / “Manage Your Solution” SSCUIs plus the in-app (key-user) or developer-extensibility BAdI tools.  \nIn practice you work through the following steps – always in the sequence shown.\n\n1. Analyse and decide  \n   • Identify the business object (billing document, purchase order, payment file, …) and the country/region.  \n   • Make sure SAP does not already ship a standard EDP process for the same requirement.\n\n2. Create the process header (SSCUI 105069 – “Define Processes for Electronic Document Processing”)  \n   • Enter a Process ID, country/region, business object, description and set the life-cycle status to “In Preparation”.  \n   • The header only says “there will be a process”, no logic yet.\n\n3. Define all technical steps that will later run at runtime (SSCUI 105068 – “Define Process Steps …”)  \n   For every activity you need – typical step types are Extraction, Transformation, Digital Signature, Submission, Response Handling, Archiving, etc. – you enter:  \n   • Step ID and step type  \n   • ABAP class / Cloud BAdI implementation name that will hold the coding  \n   • Optional: Maximum retries, timeout, error handling strategy\n\n4. Build the sequence (SSCUI 105070 – “Assign Process Steps to Process …”)  \n   • Assign the steps you just created to the process header.  \n   • Maintain predecessor / successor so that EDP knows the exact order in which to start each step.\n\n5. Provide the coding for the steps  \n   • Start the “Custom Logic” (Key-user) or ADT (Developer Extensibility) tool.  \n   • Implement the Cloud BAdIs that you referenced in Step 3 (examples: EDP_EXTRACT, EDP_TRANSFORM, EDP_SUBMIT, EDP_HANDLE_RESPONSE …).  \n   • Activate and unit-test each implementation.\n\n6. Expose the process to the application layer  \n   • SSCUI 105072 – “Assign Processes to Application Objects / Company Codes”.  \n   • Specify for which company codes, document types, sales orgs, etc., the new process shall be triggered.\n\n7. Maintain the required communication objects (only when the document has to be sent outward)  \n   • Create a communication user, system, scenario and arrangement.  \n   • In the involved “communication” step maintain the destination (HTTP, SFTP, PEPPOL, etc.).\n\n8. Test end-to-end  \n   • Create a source document in the system.  \n   • Use the Fiori app “Manage Electronic Documents” to generate / send it.  \n   • Monitor each step; make sure the document reaches “Completed” or “Acknowledged” status.  \n   • Adjust mapping, BAdIs or SSCUI entries until the process is stable.\n\n9. Transport to Production  \n   • Collect the SSCUI configuration entries and the ABAP classes/BAdI implementations in a Software Collection.  \n   • Move the collection from the DEV tenant to Q and finally to PROD.\n\nThese nine activities are the standard, SAP-recommended way to develop a brand-new electronic-document process in the Electronic Document Processing framework in an SAP S/4HANA Public-Cloud environment.",

         "In the Data Replication Cockpit (DRC) every replication “Process” is technically linked to a SOAP-based web service.  \nIf the service you want to use does not yet exist in your S/4HANA Cloud system, you first have to create an ABAP proxy for it and register the proxy in DRC.  \nThe complete procedure – which you perform in the S/4HANA Cloud Fiori launchpad – is outlined below.\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n1. Preparation – collect the service data\n--------------------------------------------------\n• Obtain the WSDL URL or the ESR name of the service interface that will be called from S/4HANA Cloud (outbound) or that will call S/4HANA Cloud (inbound).  \n• Decide on a package (e.g. ZDRC_PROXY) and a transport request in the Customizing tenant where the proxy has to be stored.  \n• Make sure you have the SAP_BR_CONF_EXPERT or an equivalent role that gives you access to the required SSCUIs and apps.\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n2. Generate the ABAP proxy\n--------------------------------------------------\n1. Open the Fiori app “Enterprise Service Browser” (or “Create / Edit ABAP Integration Object” – the app name can differ slightly depending on release).  \n2. Choose “Create > Service Consumer (Outbound)” or “Create > Service Provider (Inbound)”.  \n3. Paste the WSDL URL or select the Enterprise Service from the ES Repository.  \n4. Maintain:\n   – Proxy class name (e.g. ZCL_BP_REPL_REQ_OUT)  \n   – Short description  \n   – Package / transport request  \n5. Finish → the system generates the proxy class and related DDIC artefacts.  \n6. Press “Activate”.  The proxy now exists technically in your tenant.\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n3. Expose the proxy in SOA-Manager (is done automatically in Public Cloud)\n--------------------------------------------------\nAfter activation the system automatically creates an SOA-Manager entry (no manual work is necessary in Public Cloud systems).  \nIf you want to inspect the entry: open the “Communication Arrangements” app later on; you will find the service in the arrangement you create there.\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n4. Register the proxy in DRC\n--------------------------------------------------\n1. Open the SSCUI / Configuration Step “Define Proxies for Web Services” (Configuration activity ID 100399).  \n   IMG path: Cross-Application Components → Data Replication → Settings for Web Service Replication → Define Proxies for Web Services  \n2. Choose “New Entries” and fill in:\n   – Proxy Name  : the ABAP proxy class you have just generated  \n   – Applic. Obj.: the replication object (e.g. BUS1006 for Business Partner)  \n   – Direction    : 1 = Outbound, 2 = Inbound  \n   – Description  : free text  \n3. Save.\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n5. Create / adapt the Communication Arrangement\n--------------------------------------------------\n1. Open the Fiori app “Communication Systems” and create (or reuse) a system that represents the external receiver / sender.  \n2. Open the app “Communication Arrangements”.  \n3. Create a new arrangement; choose a scenario that contains your web service interface (e.g. SAP_COM_0008 for BP replication).  \n4. Assign the communication system, maintain host, port, path, authentication, certificates, etc.  \n   When you save, the runtime binding for the ABAP proxy is created.\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n6. Create the replication Process in DRC\n--------------------------------------------------\n1. Open the “Data Replication Cockpit” app.  \n2. Go to the tile “Processes” and press “Create”.  \n3. Select:\n   – Replication Object  (e.g. Business Partner)  \n   – Replication Model   (e.g. Web Service)  \n   – Proxy               : pick the proxy you defined in step 4  \n   – Target System       : the Communication System from step 5  \n   – Filter / Variant    : if required (e.g. by BP grouping, plant, sales org …)  \n4. Save and activate the process.\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n7. Test\n--------------------------------------------------\nUse the Cockpit function “Replicate Data Immediately” or schedule an MC Job to check whether the data is sent / received correctly via the new proxy.  \nYou can trace the call in Monitor Message (tile “SOAP Message Monitor”) or in the “Application Log” tile of the cockpit.\n\n--------------------------------------------------\nResult\n--------------------------------------------------\nYou now have:  \n• an ABAP proxy that represents the SOAP service,  \n• a communication arrangement that binds the proxy to an external endpoint, and  \n• a DRC Process that uses the proxy to replicate master or transactional data.",

         "Below is the end-to-end recipe that SAP recommends when you have to add a brand-new Document and Reporting Compliance (DRC) “process” in SAP S/4HANA Public Cloud for an Italian customer, using ONLY the in-app (public-cloud-compliant) extensibility features.  \nThe sequence shown is valid for both a completely new statutory report and for an additional e-document flow; the wording “process” is used exactly as it appears in the Fiori apps.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────\nPrerequisites\n────────────────────────────────────────\n• Scope items are already activated in Central Business Configuration (CBC):  \n  5HJ (DRC foundation) + at least one Italian scope item such as 5YZ (Sales E-Invoice – Italy) or 5LB (Advance VAT Return – Italy).  \n• You have one of the following business roles:  \n  SAP_BR_DRC_EXPERT  (configuration)  \n  SAP_BR_DRC_ANALYST (testing)  \n• Your user is also allowed to create Custom CDS Views (SAP_BR_ANALYTICS_SPECIALIST) if a new data source is needed.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────\nStep-by-step creation of the new process\n────────────────────────────────────────\n\n1. Start the Fiori app “Manage Document and Reporting Compliance – Extensibility”.\n   (Tile name can differ slightly; in older tenants it is “Manage DRC Extensibility Settings”.)\n\n2. Press Create → Process.\n   Mandatory header fields:\n   – Process ID              : ZIT_<your_suffix> (Z-namespace)  \n   – Description             : Free text  \n   – Country/Region          : IT  \n   – Process Category        : Statutory Reporting  OR  Electronic Document  \n   – Valid-From              : Today’s date or 1st day of fiscal year\n\n3. (Optional) Copy from an SAP template  \n   If the requirement is only a variation of an SAP Italy process, choose “Based on existing process” and select e.g. IT_EINVOICE or IT_VAT_RETURN.  \n   The system copies data source, mappings and formats, which you can then adapt.\n\n4. Assign the relevant company codes / tax numbers\n   In the Process header choose “Assign Organizational Units” and add the Italian company codes that must run this process.\n\n5. Supply / build the data source\n   5a. If the SAP CDS view I_BillingDocument or similar already delivers every field you need, pick it in the “Data Source” field.  \n   5b. If not, open the app “Custom CDS Views”, create a view that joins all required tables, publish it, then return to the process and select that view.  \n   (In public cloud you cannot use SE11 or ABAP Dictionary.)\n\n6. Map process fields to data fields\n   Open section “Field Mapping”.  \n   For each “Reporting Field” shown on the left, point to the CDS field on the right.  \n   Fields that need transformation can be handled by the in-app BAdI “DRC_DATA_ENRICHMENT” (Create → Enhancement Implementation → Code your logic in ABAP for Key Users).\n\n7. Maintain output structure / submission format\n   • For Statutory Reporting: choose XML, TXT, or Spreadsheet and upload or design the file layout.  \n   • For Electronic documents: pick the existing SAP XML schema, or upload your own if the Authority provides a different XSD.  \n   Note that Adobe forms (PDF) are uploaded in the app “Maintain Form Templates” and referenced here.\n\n8. Define the communication channel (e-documents only)\n   • Select “Communication Arrangement” and copy an SAP template for SDI if available (Italy’s Exchange System).  \n   • Fill endpoint URL, user, password / certificate.  \n   • Test connection immediately (“Ping” button).\n\n9. Activate the BAdIs (only if you created them in step 6 or need additional ones)\n   Typical public-cloud BAdIs:  \n   – DRC_DATA_RETRIEVAL_EXT  (to influence data selection)  \n   – DRC_OUTPUT_PARAMETER_DET (to steer file name, receiver ID, etc.)  \n   – DRC_POSTPROCESSING_EXT   (for post-submission events)\n\n10. Validate and Activate the process\n    Hit the “Check” button. All mapping lines must be green and at least one Output / File Format must be assigned.  \n    Press “Activate”. From now on the process is visible in the operational apps.\n\n11. Authorize the business users\n    Give the Italian key users the business role SAP_BR_DRC_ANALYST or SAP_BR_DRC_REPORT_SPECIALIST and, if needed, the role that allows “Submit Statutory Reports”.\n\n12. Test end-to-end\n    a. Open “Run Statutory Reports” or “Manage Electronic Documents”.  \n    b. Choose the new process, company code, period.  \n    c. Execute – verify the preview file.  \n    d. For e-documents -> Submit; for reports -> Download or Submit (depending on what you configured).\n\n13. Transport to the production tenant\n    a. Open “Export Software Collection”, add the Process (customizing object type DRC_PR).  \n    b. Release collection, then import it in the P-system via “Import Collection”.  \n\n────────────────────────────────────────\nResult\n────────────────────────────────────────\nYour Italian customer now has a brand-new DRC process, completely cloud-compliant, which \n• extracts the required data through a custom or SAP CDS view,  \n• maps it in the Extensibility cockpit,  \n• produces the correct XML/TXT/PDF layout, and  \n• submits (or stores) the file exactly as requested by the Italian tax authority/SDI.",

However, it also contains some inaccuracies and omissions when compared to the expert answer and the retrieved documentation.\n\nCorrect points:\n1. The answer correctly states that users cannot directly create transparent database tables in SAP S/4HANA Public Cloud as they would in on-premise systems.\n2. It provides alternative solutions such as Custom Business Objects (CBO), Custom Fields & Logic, and Custom CDS Views, which align with the extensibility options mentioned in the documentation.\n\nInaccuracies and omissions:\n1. The answer fails to mention that SAP does create specific database tables for DRC purposes, such as EDOPTBUPA and EDOPTINV, as indicated in the documentation.\n2. It doesn't address the fact that customers can enable custom fields in the eDocument Cockpit/Manage Electronic Documents Fiori App through Developer Extensibility and Key User Extensibility, which is an important aspect of DRC extensibility in Public Cloud.\n3. The answer doesn't mention the use of multiple instances of Hana Cloud DB for DRC, which is part of the database setup for DRC in the Public Cloud environment.\n4. While the side-by-side persistence on SAP BTP is mentioned as an option, it doesn't explain how this relates specifically to DRC extensibility use cases.\n\nIn conclusion, while the generated answer provides some useful information about alternatives to creating database tables directly, it lacks specific details about DRC extensibility capabilities in SAP Public Cloud and misses some important aspects of how database tables are actually used and managed in this context.",

         "No, the SAP S/4HANA Public Cloud system itself does not let you create your own transparent database tables the way you would in an on-premise or private-cloud ABAP system (SE11/ABAP Dictionary).  \n\nWhat you can do instead\n\n1. Custom Business Objects (CBO)  \n   • Use the “Custom Business Objects” Fiori app to model and persist your own data.  \n   • The framework generates and manages the underlying tables, but you never access them directly; you work with the CBO APIs.  \n   • CBO data can be consumed in Custom CDS Views and therefore in DRC (Document & Reporting Compliance / ACR) reports.\n\n2. Custom Fields & Logic  \n   • Add custom fields to released business contexts and expose them in the DRC data sources.\n\n3. Custom CDS Views  \n   • Build CDS views that join standard tables with your CBOs (or other released views) and use those CDS views as the data source for your new country report.\n\n4. Side-by-side persistence on SAP BTP (optional)  \n   • If you need “real” tables that you can design freely, create them in an ABAP Environment (Steampunk) or HANA Cloud database on BTP and call them via released APIs from S/4HANA Cloud.\n\nSo, for a DRC extensibility scenario for a new country, you do not create a database table in the Public Cloud tenant; you use the key-user tools (CBO, Custom Fields, Custom CDS Views) or store the data side-by-side on BTP.",

         "The “country/region-level handler” is the single ABAP class that the Document and Reporting Compliance (DRC) framework calls whenever it must do something that can vary from one country/region to another (fill specific XML tags, set defaults, do a legal calculation, decide whether a document must be reported, …).  \nIn an SAP S/4HANA Public Cloud system you create that class with developer extensibility (ABAP Cloud) and then tell DRC which class it has to use for which country/region and scenario.  \nThe procedure is therefore always a combination of\n\n1. Development (create the class in ADT and implement the released interface).  \n2. Customizing (assign the class to a country/region and a DRC scenario).  \n\nBelow is the step-by-step cookbook that SAP gives in their extensibility guide.\n\n\n\n=====================================================\n1. Prerequisites\n=====================================================\n\n• Your tenant is enabled for “Developer Extensibility” (Embedded Steampunk).  \n• You have the business catalog SAP_CORE_BC_EXT_DEV (role SAP_BR_DEVELOPER) and a software component in the customer namespace (Z… or YY1…).  \n• You know the DRC scenario for which you want to add logic (for example: E_DOCUMENT, VAT_REPORTING, ICMS_BR, etc.).  \n• You have the released interface name that the framework expects.  For country/region handlers the interface is IF_DRC_EX_CTY_HANDLER (from S4CORE) – all countries use the same interface.\n\n=====================================================\n2. Create the package and the class (ADT/Eclipse)\n=====================================================\n\n01. In ADT choose File ▶ New ▶ ABAP Package →  \n    • Name: Z_DRC_EXT  \n    • Type: Development  \n    • Software component: ZLOCAL (or the customer software component you got)  \n    • Transport layer: $TMP (or a real transport if you already have a route).\n\n02. Inside the package create a new ABAP class  \n    • Name: ZCL_DRC_FR_HANDLER          (example for France)  \n    • Description: Country-level handler – France  \n    • Final / Public / Instantiable  \n    • Add interface IF_DRC_EX_CTY_HANDLER in the “Interfaces” field.  \n      ADT automatically adds the following methods that you must implement:\n\n       – IF_DRC_EX_CTY_HANDLER~GET_VERSION  \n       – IF_DRC_EX_CTY_HANDLER~IS_ACTIVE  \n       – IF_DRC_EX_CTY_HANDLER~FILL_HEADER_DATA  \n       – IF_DRC_EX_CTY_HANDLER~FILL_ITEM_DATA  \n       – IF_DRC_EX_CTY_HANDLER~BEFORE_SERIALIZE  \n       – IF_DRC_EX_CTY_HANDLER~AFTER_SERIALIZE  \n       – … (the list can change slightly with new releases ‑ implement what the wizard proposes).\n\n03. Implement the methods using only released APIs (no SELECT … FROM mara!).  \n    Small example:\n\n    METHOD if_drc_ex_cty_handler~is_active.\n      \"You could switch off the handler by SSCUI flag or by date\n      rv_active = abap_true.\n    ENDMETHOD.\n\n    METHOD if_drc_ex_cty_handler~fill_header_data.\n      \"Add a French specific node in the XML buffer\n      DATA(lo_header) = io_builder->get_header( ).\n      lo_header->add_value( iv_name  = 'FRSpecificTag'\n                            iv_value = '12345' ).\n    ENDMETHOD.\n\n04. Activate the class.  If checks are green you are done with the development part.\n\n\n\n=====================================================\n3. Register the class in configuration\n=====================================================\n\nYou now have to tell DRC for which country/region and for which scenario the system shall call the new class.\n\nAPP: “Manage Your Solution” → Configure Your Solution  \n             Application Area …  FIN  ▶  Sub-application … Document and Reporting Compliance  \n             Configuration Step: “Define Country/Region-Level Handler Class” (SSCUI 104829)\n\nPress “Configure” – New Entries:\n\n• Country/Region       FR  \n• Scenario             VAT_REPORTING            (or the ID SAP gives, e.g. JPK_PL, E_DOCUMENT)  \n• Implementation ID    Z_FR_VAT                (any key, 8 char)  \n• Handler Class        ZCL_DRC_FR_HANDLER  \n• Active               X  \n• Description          French country handler for DRC VAT reporting\n\nSave and transport the customizing.\n\n\n\n=====================================================\n4. Test the extension\n=====================================================\n\n1. Run the corresponding DRC application (e.g. “Run Advanced Compliance Reports” or “Create Electronic Documents”).  \n2. Put an external breakpoint in one of your methods (remember HTTP debugging).  \n3. Create or re-generate a document – execution stops in your class → the registration works.  \n4. Remove breakpoints, run the legal content validation app and check that the expected French tag/value is present.\n\n=====================================================\n5. Transport to Q- and P-System\n=====================================================\n\n• ABAP object: captured in a cABAP transport (gCTS repository).  \n• Customizing: automatically recorded in an SSCUI transport request.  \nFollow the normal “Export to Q” → “Import to P” process.\n\n=====================================================\n6. House-keeping & Tips\n=====================================================\n\n• Naming: ZZ* or YY1* only, otherwise the class will not pass the cloud whitelist check.  \n• Only released APIs: use ADT code completion (Ctrl+Space shows the green dot).  \n• Keep the class stateless (no global attributes that hold document state across calls).  \n• Do not call COMMIT WORK or perform database updates – return data only; DRC will handle persistence.  \n• Each handler can serve several scenarios but one entry per (Country/Region, Scenario) must exist in the SSCUI.  \n• If logic must vary by company code, plant, etc. you can read those values from the importing parameters of the interface and branch accordingly.\n\nThat is the whole procedure: develop the ABAP Cloud class, assign it in SSCUI 104829, test, and transport.",

         "Short answer  \nNo – in the public-cloud edition of SAP S/4HANA you cannot create your own ABAP class to change or enhance Document & Reporting Compliance (DRC) process mapping. Public-cloud tenants only let you use the DRC functions that SAP has released for key-user or developer extensibility, and at the moment SAP has not released any BAdI, interface or API that would allow you to plug in a self-written ABAP class for process mapping.  \n\nWhy it does not work  \n\n1. Extensibility model  \n   • Key-user (in-app) extensibility = Custom Fields, Custom Logic BAdIs, etc.  \n   • Developer (embedded Steampunk) extensibility = ABAP Cloud classes but only on released APIs.  \n   • Side-by-side on SAP BTP.  \n\n2. What DRC exposes today in public cloud  \n   • Configuration apps (Process Settings, Determination tables, Assign content, etc.).  \n   • Few key-user BAdIs (e.g. ACR_DOC_VALIDATION, ACR_DOC_ENRICHMENT) – none of them covers “Process Mapping”.  \n   • No released ABAP interface, global class, CDS view or RAP facet for the process-mapping step. Therefore ABAP Cloud code cannot legally call or redefine anything in that area.  \n\n3. Public-cloud guard rails  \n   • You cannot create new repository objects that are not on the released whitelist.  \n   • Customer-specific subclasses of SAP internal classes (CL_ACR_DCS_PROCESS_MAPPING* in on-prem) are forbidden because those classes are not released in public cloud.  \n\nWhat you can do instead  \n\n• Try to achieve the required mapping by configuration (Manage Process Settings, output parameter determination).  \n• Use the key-user BAdIs that are available for document enrichment/validation if they solve your need.  \n• If you definitely need an own ABAP implementation of the mapping logic you have to run DRC in S/4HANA private-cloud or on-prem (where the enhancement spots and exit classes are open) or build the extra logic side-by-side on SAP BTP and call DRC via the public APIs.  \n\nTherefore, with the current 23xx/24xx public-cloud releases the creation of an ABAP class for DRC process mapping is not supported.",

         "The generated answer provides some useful information about BAdIs required for extending a new process in DRC Extensibility in Public Cloud, but it differs significantly from the expert answer and the information provided by the SAP documentation summary. Here's a breakdown of the evaluation:\n\n1. The generated answer mentions two mandatory BAdIs (DRC_EVENT_BASED_TRIGGER and DRC_EVENT_BASED_DATA_PROVIDER) for every new process, which are not mentioned in the expert answer or the SAP documentation summary.\n\n2. The expert answer lists three specific BAdIs (EDOCUMENT_INT_CONN_EXT, EDOCUMENT_BASE_EXT, and EDOCUMENT_MESSAGE_EXT) as required for extending a newly created process. These are not mentioned in the generated answer.\n\n3. The SAP documentation summary provides information about different BAdIs (EDOC_ADAPTOR_CLOUD, ES_EDOCUMENT_PT_CLOUD) and enhancement spots, which are not mentioned in either the generated answer or the expert answer.\n\n4. The generated answer provides more detailed explanations about the purpose and functionality of the BAdIs it mentions, which could be helpful for understanding their role in the process extension.\n\n5. Both the generated answer and the expert answer mention that there are optional BAdIs available for further customization, which aligns with the information in the SAP documentation summary about various enhancement capabilities.\n\nWhile the generated answer offers some valuable insights into the process of extending DRC functionality, it doesn't accurately match the specific BAdIs mentioned in the expert answer. The discrepancy in the BAdIs mentioned across all sources (generated answer, expert answer, and documentation summary) suggests that there might be different approaches or versions of DRC extensibility, or that the information might be incomplete or outdated in some sources.\n\nGiven these discrepancies, the answer is classified as \"Partially Helpful\" because it provides relevant information about the concept of using BAdIs for DRC extensibility, but it doesn't accurately match the specific BAdIs mentioned in the expert answer, which was the primary question.",

BAdI for the event/trigger decision  \n   Technical name (as of 2308): DRC_EVENT_BASED_TRIGGER  \n   • Is called as soon as a business transaction (FI posting, billing document, MM movement, etc.) occurs.  \n   • Your implementation decides whether this transaction is relevant for the new process and returns the key fields that identify the future “process instance”.\n\n2. BAdI for data provision  \n   Technical name (as of 2308): DRC_EVENT_BASED_DATA_PROVIDER  \n   • Is called right after a trigger has been confirmed.  \n   • Reads the required business data (header and items) and hands it back to DRC in the canonical structure so that the subsequent DRC run steps (enrichment, validation, generation, submission) can take place.\n\nAll other BAdIs shipped with DRC (enrichment, output format, post-processing, acknowledgement, and so on) are optional and are only implemented if you want to change the delivered standard behaviour.  \nTherefore, the two BAdIs above are the ones that are required to extend a completely new Process in DRC Extensibility in the SAP S/4HANA public cloud.",

         "In SAP S/4HANA Cloud, public edition, every customer enhancement – including the one that is needed to enrich the XML that is sent to the Spanish tax authority (SII) – has to be done with the in-app extensibility tools.  \nThe BAdI that SAP delivers for this purpose is ­EDOCUMENT_BASE_EXT.  \nThe procedure below follows the sequence that SAP Product Assistance and SAP Note 3090501 describe and has already been used in live Spanish Cloud projects.\n\nPrerequisites  \n• System: SAP S/4HANA Cloud, public edition (3-system landscape).  \n• Business scope: J58 (Document Compliance – Spain, SII).  \n• User role: SAP_BR_EXTENSIBILITY_DEVELOPER or equivalent.\n\nStep-by-step procedure\n\n1. Decide what you have to add or change  \n   – Typical Spanish examples are “Clave Régimen Especial”, “Factura Sustitutiva”, “Factura Recapitulativa”, etc.  \n   – If the value does not yet exist in the source document, create a custom field first.\n\n2. (Optional) Create the custom field(s)  \n   a. Open app “Custom Fields”.  \n   b. Business context e.g. “Sales: Billing Document – Header” or “Sales: Billing Document – Item”.  \n   c. Add the field, keep “Enable Usage” in “OData” and “Write” checked.  \n   d. Publish.  \n   The field will automatically be appended (YY1_…) to the extension include that the BAdI can read.\n\n3. Implement the BAdI with the “Custom Logic” app  \n   a. Launch “Custom Logic”.  \n   b. Create → New.  \n      – Business Context: “Electronic Document Base Extension”  \n      – BAdI: EDOCUMENT_BASE_EXT  \n      – Implementation description: e.g. “ES – enrich header for SII”.  \n   c. Maintain filter values (important, otherwise the logic is executed for every country):  \n      – Company Code = ESxx (your Spanish companies)  \n      – EDocument Type  = ‘SII’ (or leave blank and check I_EDOC_PROCESS_ID inside the code).  \n   d. Choose “API state = Unrestricted”.  \n   e. Press Create.\n\n4. Write the ABAP logic (restricted ABAP)  \n   The BAdI contains three methods; for SII you normally use the first two:\n\n   METHOD if_edocument_base_ext~fill_edoc_header.  \n\n     \"Read billing header extension incl. custom fields  \n     SELECT SINGLE * FROM vbrk                         \"Billing header  \n          WHERE vbeln = @is_doc_object-key_vbeln  \n          INTO @DATA(ls_vbrk).\n\n     \"Example: fill Special Regime Code from custom field YY1_REGIMECODE_ES  \n     IF ls_vbrk-yy1_regimecode_es IS NOT INITIAL.  \n       cs_edoc_header-edi_es_regime_code = ls_vbrk-yy1_regimecode_es.  \n     ENDIF.\n\n   ENDMETHOD.\n\n   METHOD if_edocument_base_ext~fill_edoc_item.\n\n     LOOP AT ct_edoc_item ASSIGNING FIELD-SYMBOL(<ls_item>).  \n       \"Read item data (or use the already imported structure)  \n       SELECT SINGLE * FROM vbrp  \n              WHERE vbeln = @is_doc_object-key_vbeln  \n                AND posnr = @<ls_item>-item_no  \n              INTO @DATA(ls_vbrp).\n\n       \"Example: set Indicator for ‘Entrega Gratuita’ from custom field  \n       IF ls_vbrp-yy1_freegoods_es = abap_true.  \n         <ls_item>-edi_es_freegoods_ind = 'S'.        \"Sí  \n       ENDIF.  \n     ENDLOOP.\n\n   ENDMETHOD.\n\n   METHOD if_edocument_base_ext~modify_edoc_prop.  \n     \"Only if you have to change properties such as document subtype.  \n   ENDMETHOD.\n\n   f.

Transport to Q-system and P-system  \n   – After the implementation is ‘Published’ in the development tenant, include it in a software collection and release/transport in the usual Cloud way (Export Software Collection).\n\n6. Test the enhancement  \n   a. Create or change a billing document.  \n   b. Open the app “Submit eDocument” (Spain SII) or schedule job “Generate and Submit eDocuments – Spain”.  \n   c. In the “Monitor eDocuments” app open the XML preview.  \n   d. Verify that the nodes you enriched (Régimen, TipoFactura, etc.) now contain the expected values.\n\n7. Troubleshooting & Logs  \n   – Use app “Application Log” (Object EDOCUMENT, Subobject ES_SII).  \n   – The runtime message will show whether the BAdI ran and which values were finally transferred.\n\nKey points to remember for Public Cloud\n\n• All electronic-document extensions must go through the in-app tool “Custom Logic”; SPRO/SE19 is not available.  \n• Restrict your logic with filters (company code, process ID) to avoid affecting other countries.  \n• Only released ABAP artefacts can be used; use CDS views or public interfaces, no direct SELECT on internal tables that are not whitelisted.  \n• After every new release (upgrade) retest the BAdI – field catalogues for SII are sometimes extended by SAP.\n\nBy following the steps above you implement BAdI EDOCUMENT_BASE_EXT in S/4HANA Cloud, public edition, enabling Spanish customer-specific information to be added to the SII XML without modification of the SAP standard.",

However, it differs significantly from the expert answer and lacks some key aspects mentioned in the SAP documentation summary.\n\nPositive aspects:\n1. The answer provides a complete, working code example that can be used in an SAP S/4HANA Public Cloud tenant.\n2. It includes explanations of the scenario, custom fields, and how to use the sample code.\n3. The code demonstrates the use of released objects (CDS views) suitable for the restricted ABAP environment of the public cloud.\n\nAreas for improvement:\n1. The generated answer implements the GET_DATA method, which is not mentioned in the expert answer or the documentation summary. The expert answer focuses on DETERMINE_EDOCUMENT_CLASS and DETERMINE_PROCESS methods.\n2. The answer doesn't include the determination of the eDocument class name or process name/version, which are key aspects mentioned in both the expert answer and the documentation summary.\n3. It doesn't explicitly mention the enhancement spot ES_EDOCUMENT_EXT, which is part of the implementation process according to the documentation.\n\nWhile the generated answer provides valuable information and a working example, it doesn't fully align with the expert answer or the specific aspects highlighted in the SAP documentation summary for the BAdI EDOCUMENT_BASE_EXT.

         "In the DRC (Document & Reporting Compliance) framework every piece of legislation that is handled – an electronic invoice, an electronic transport document, a sales-listing file, etc. – is processed as an “eDocument”.  \nThe system therefore needs one master key that tells DRC:\n\n• what kind of legal document this is,  \n• where the data come from (FI, SD, MM …),  \n• which mapping/transformation rules have to run,  \n• which communication scenario (PEPPOL, web-service, file, API …) has to be used,  \n• which statuses have to be shown in the monitor,  \n• which enhancement points (BAdIs, RAP actions, AIF checks) are active for it.\n\nThat master key is the eDocument Type.\n\nWhy you must create a new eDocument Type when you build your own process with DRC extensibility\n\n1. Separation from SAP-delivered content  \n   – SAP ships the standard eDocument Types that belong to delivered localisations.  \n   – By creating your own (usually starting with “Z”), you keep your custom scenario isolated and upgrade-safe.\n\n2. Customising container  \n   All subsequent Customising or CBC steps are made “per eDocument Type”: mapping profile, determination object, output channel, monitor layout, AIF interface, status scheme, etc. Without the type you have no place to store these settings.\n\n3. Runtime steering  \n   At runtime the framework reads the eDocument Type that the application (SD billing, FI posting, MM PO …) passed to it.  \n   Based on that key the system decides which processing class, BAdIs, validation profile, service endpoint, etc., it must call.  \n   If you reused an SAP type, you would either break the SAP scenario or your own.\n\n4. Legal traceability  \n   Authorities usually require different reference numbering, archives, signature keys and submission endpoints per obligation. Those elements are all linked to the eDocument Type.\n\n5. Monitor and error handling  \n   The DRC Monitor groups and filters documents by their eDocument Type. Creating your own type gives you a dedicated tile or variant where users see only the documents of your new process and the status texts that belong to it.\n\nIn short: the eDocument Type is the anchor that binds together the source business document, the mapping logic, the communication arrangement, the status management and the user interface for one specific legal process. Therefore the very first step when you create a new DRC scenario in SAP S/4HANA Cloud is to create (copy) and adapt an eDocument Type.",

         "Because an SAP S/4HANA Private-Cloud system does not differ very much from an on-premise system with regard to interface technology, you have to prepare exactly the same three areas that you would prepare in an on-premise environment.  \nThe external application can send documents only after\n\n1. a technical route to the tenant exists,  \n2. SAP knows the partner (logical system / communication system), and  \n3. at least one inbound interface (IDoc, Web-service, OData, file, …) is fully configured and authorised.\n\nBelow you find the minimum settings that always have to be in place, followed by the typical IDoc and Web-service examples that most customers use.\n\n————————————————————————————————————————\nA. Technical connectivity (always required)\n————————————————————————————————————————\n• Network path  \n  – Establish a secure tunnel: VPN, SAProuter, Private-Link or the SAP Cloud Connector.  \n  – Ask SAP Basis to open the firewall for the chosen protocol/port.\n\n• Technical destination inside SAP  \n  – SM59  (RFC / HTTP destination) with user, password/SNC, time-out, TLS parameters.  \n  – Test the destination (ping / connection test).\n\n• User that the external system will log on with  \n  – Create a service / communication user.  \n  – Assign only the authorisations needed for the interface (see below).\n\n————————————————————————————————————————\nB. Identify the partner to SAP (always required)\n————————————————————————————————————————\n1. Logical System (BD54) – create an entry for the external application.  \n2. Assign that logical system to the current SAP client (SCC4).  \n3. If you are using the modern “communication-scenario approach”, create\n   – Communication System (app “Communication Systems”)  \n   – Communication User (app “Maintain Communication Users”)  \n   – Communication Arrangement for the SAP-delivered scenario.\n\n————————————————————————————————————————\nC. Define the inbound interface (choose one of the following)\n————————————————————————————————————————\n1. IDoc / ALE (still the most frequently used)  \n   • Port – WE21 (RFC-port or XML/HTTP port that points to the SM59 destination).  \n   • Partner profile – WE20  \n     – Partner type = LS, partner name = logical system from (B)  \n     – Inbound parameters: message type, basic-IDoc type, process code, “Process immediately / in batch” etc.  \n   • Optional (mainly for outbound): distribution model BD64, change pointers BD50.  \n   • Make sure the inbound process code (WE42) is linked to the correct posting FM and is released.  \n   • Authorisations for the interface user: S_IDOC, B_ALE_RECV, S_RFC (for the posting FM), S_DATASET if file port, etc.\n\n2. SOAP Web Service (traditional Enterprise Service, PI/PO, CPI etc.)  \n   • Activate the service in SOAMANAGER (or use SAP Gateway Activation).  \n   • Maintain the Provider Agreement in SOAMANAGER and give the WSDL / endpoint to the partner.  \n   • Communication user needs S_SERVICE, S_SRT, S_RFC, or the roles that SAP delivers with the service.\n\n3. OData / REST API (whitelisted APIs)  \n   • Activate the OData service in /IWFND/MAINT_SERVICE.  \n   • Create a communication scenario (if none exists) or use SAP-delivered scenario SAP_COM_XXXX.  \n   • Create Communication System + Arrangement; this generates the OAuth2 / Basic authentication endpoint.  \n   • Assign role SAP_BR_XXX_API (for example, role SAP_BR_BUPA_API for business-partner APIs) to the communication user.\n\n4. File / SFTP import  \n   • Have SAP Basis mount the SFTP directory or configure SAP’s “File Receiver” in PI/CPI.  \n   • Maintain a FILE port in WE21 (for IDocs) or configure ABAP program / OPT archive job that picks up the file.  \n   • Give the operating-system or SFTP credentials to SAP (they will be stored in Secure Store).\n\n5. ArchiveLink / Content Server (for attachments)  \n   • Create Content Repository (OAC0).  \n   • Maintain HTTP connection type “Content Server” that points to OpenText or any CMIS-compliant server.  \n   • Activate document types (OAC2) and link them to application objects (OAC3).  \n   • Provide the service user with S_WFAR, S_ARCHIVE, S_HTTP.\n\n————————————————————————————————————————\nD. Final checks\n————————————————————————————————————————\n• Run transaction WE19 (IDoc test) or call the service URL with a tool such as Postman to make sure SAP receives something.  \n• If an IDoc is received but stops with status 56 (“Partner profile not found”) or status 51 (“Application document not posted”), the partner profile or posting function module is wrong.  \n• If a Web-service call returns HTTP 401, the communication user or authorisation is missing.  \n• Make sure error messages get to a monitor that someone is actually checking (AIF, IDoc Monitor WE02/WE05, SRT_MONI, SLG1, etc.).\n\n————————————————————————————————————————\nSummary\n————————————————————————————————————————\nBefore any external system can send documents to your SAP S/4HANA Private-Cloud tenant you must:\n\n1. Provide an end-to-end network route and a technical destination in SAP.  \n2. Register the partner (logical system / communication system) in SAP.  \n3. Fully configure at least one inbound interface (IDoc, SOAP, OData, file, ArchiveLink) including partner profile or communication arrangement.  \n4. Create and authorise the technical user that the external system will use.  \n\nOnce these four building blocks are in place, the external application can transmit its documents and SAP will be able to receive and post or archive them automatically.",

Give every participating client and system a logical-system name  \n   • Transaction SCC4 – assign a logical system to the SAP client (the “own” LS)  \n   • Transaction BD54 – create a logical-system entry for the external application\n\n2. Create the technical connection to the partner system  \n   • Transaction SM59 – RFC destination (type T for TCP/IP or 3 for ABAP) that points to the external system and that uses a communication user with the required ALE/IDoc authorisations  \n   • STRUST – import / trust the certificates if the connection is over HTTPS\n\n3. Define the port that SAP will use to receive the IDocs  \n   • Transaction WE21 – create an IDoc port of type “tRFC” (or “HTTP/XML” if you exchange IDocs over HTTP) and link it to the RFC destination you just created\n\n4. Maintain the partner profile for the external system  \n   • Transaction WE20 – Partner type “LS” (logical system)  \n     – Inbound parameters  list every IDoc message/basic type that the external system will send, assign the process code & posting function (trigger immediately or via background program)  \n     – (If you also have to send documents from SAP to the partner, maintain the outbound parameters here as well)\n\n5. (Optional but normally needed) Build or adjust the distribution model  \n   • Transaction BD64 – Adds your message types to a “model view”; this is vital for change-pointer generation and for any outbound traffic you might have later\n\n6. Activate/change-pointer settings and posting FM if required  \n   • SALE  “Activate change pointers”, “Assign FM to message type”, etc.\n\n7. Technical prerequisites  \n   • Communication user is unlocked and has S_IDOC*, S_ALE*, S_RFC* etc.  \n   • Network path is open (VPN, SAP-Router, SAP Cloud Connector) and the SAP listener port (RFC or HTTPS) is reachable/whitelisted.\n\nOnce the above objects exist the external system can start sending its IDocs / XML documents. The SAP Private-Cloud system recognises the logical-system name in the control record, finds the partner profile, accepts the IDoc on the defined port, and posts the business document inside SAP.",

Keep the XML unchanged and send the extra file next to it  \n   • Implement the BAdI for the channel you are using (e-mail, EDI, web service, RFC, …).  \n     The most frequently used ones are  \n       – APOC_OUTPUT_EMAIL_BADI  (e-mail channel)  \n       – SD_BIL_OUTPUT           (billing)  \n       – PUR_SE_OUTPUT_CONTROL   (purchasing)  \n   • In method ADD_ATTACHMENT (or a similarly-named method) you read the binary of the additional file, fill structure SATTACHMENT (filename, MIME type, binary content) and append it to the CT_ATTACHMENT table that the framework passes back to the caller.  \n   • Result: the XML that SAP produces stays 100 % standard, but the receiver gets the XML plus the additional file in the same MIME message / e-mail.\n\n2. Embed the file content inside the XML (only possible if the XML format actually has a place for it, e.g. UBL’s AdditionalDocumentReference-/EmbeddedDocumentBinaryObject)  \n   • Copy SAP’s XSLT transformation that is used to build the XML (transaction STRANS) or implement the BAdI EDOC_ADJUST_XML_… that exists for most electronic-document formats.  \n   • Extend the copied XSLT or fill the corresponding BAdI parameter so that the binary of your file is base-64-encoded and written into the right XML element.  \n   • Activate the copy of the transformation / your BAdI implementation in Customizing → Output Management → Assign Form Templates / XML Programs.  \n   • Result: you still send exactly one XML file, but it now also contains the embedded attachment in base-64 format.  \n     (Keep an eye on size; many networks limit a single XML to 5–10 MB.)\n\nWhat will NOT work  \n• A purely “configuration-only” solution (there is none).  \n• Doing it in the public-cloud edition (no ABAP enhancement points there).  \n• Modifying the standard repository objects directly (copy them and register the copy, otherwise they will be overwritten by an upgrade).\n\nIn short: in the private-cloud system you can attach additional files, but you must use one of the enhancement spots listed above and add the file either (a) as a separate MIME/-e-mail attachment or (b) as base-64 data inside a suitable XML element.",

Create the enhancement implementation in ADT  \n   2.1 In the Project Explorer choose:  \n       Repository Browser → Enhancement Spots → EDOC_GREECE_XML  \n   2.2 Right-mouse → “Create BAdI Implementation”.  \n       Give the implementation a Z-name, for example Z_GR_XML_ENHANCE, put it in a customer package and transport request.  \n   2.3 Depending on what you want to do pick the correct interface:  \n       • IF_EDOC_XML_MODIFY   – to change the content of existing nodes.  \n       • IF_EDOC_XML_EXTEND   – to append completely new nodes/attributes.  \n\n3. Implement the method in the generated class  \n   The relevant method is MODIFY_XML (or EXTEND_XML).  \n   Example skeleton:\n\n   METHOD if_edoc_xml_modify~modify_xml.          \" or ~extend_xml\n     DATA: lx_doc     TYPE xstring,\n           lx_new_doc TYPE xstring.\n\n     \"Original XML is delivered in iv_xml\n     lx_doc = iv_xml.\n\n     \"Run an XSLT or Simple-Transform to add/change nodes\n     CALL TRANSFORMATION z_gr_mydata_enhance\n       SOURCE xml = lx_doc\n       RESULT xml = lx_new_doc.\n\n     \"Return manipulated XML to the framework\n     cv_xml = lx_new_doc.\n   ENDMETHOD.\n\n   • You may also build/modify the XML with DOM or SAX if you prefer.  \n   • Do not forget to keep the namespace and the schema location intact.\n\n4. Activate and transport the implementation\n\n5. Test the enhancement  \n   • Go to eDocument Cockpit (transaction EDOC_COCKPIT).  \n   • Create a test document, choose “Preview XML” – the extra information you coded must be visible.  \n   • When the document is finally sent, the Adapter picks up exactly this XML; nothing overwrites it afterwards.\n\n6. Productive usage  \n   When QA tests are successful, import the transport into the productive tenant; the BAdI runs automatically for every Greek eDocument that is generated and the XML that leaves the system already contains your additions.\n\nKey points to remember  \n• You never touch SAP standard artefacts; everything goes through the delivered BAdI.  \n• The BAdI is executed at the very last moment, therefore anything you add or change is what AADE (Greek Tax Authority) receives.  \n• All development work is done with ADT (Eclipse) because classic SE80 modifications are not permitted in Private Cloud.",

         "In the S/4HANA Cloud, private edition, the eDocument Framework can be enhanced in exactly the same way as in an on-premise system because you still have full ABAP work-bench and IMG access.  \nThe sequence below is the procedure SAP recommends if you have built a\ncustom eDocument process (Z-process) and you now want to add one or more\nnew actions (for example “Validate”, “Re-Transmit”, “Print PDF”, …).\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n1. Decide whether an own action is really required\n--------------------------------------------------\n• Use a new action only if the logic cannot be covered by:\n  – The standard “EXECUTE BAdI in action” option, or\n  – One of the delivered SAP actions that can be called from your\n    Z-process step.  \n• Remember: never change SAP entries; always create Z* entries.\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n2. Create the implementation class for the action\n--------------------------------------------------\n1. In ADT (or SE24) create a class in the customer namespace\n   (ZCL_EDOC_ACTION_XXX).  \n2. Either:\n   • Inherit from CL_EDOC_ACTION_BASE and redefine\n     method DO_EXECUTE, or\n   • Implement interface IF_EDOC_ACTION completely.\n3. Inside DO_EXECUTE / IF_EDOC_ACTION~EXECUTE you receive the table\n   ct_edoc_header with the selected eDocuments.  \n   – Build your own logic (create files, call an external web service,\n     set new status, write messages, etc.).  \n   – Use CL_EDOC_MESSAGE_HANDLER=>ADD_MESSAGE for cockpit messages.  \n4. If you need test runs, also redefine\n   IF_EDOC_ACTION~EXECUTE_SIMULATE.  \n5. Activate and transport the class.\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n3. Create the action in Customising\n--------------------------------------------------\nIMG path:\n  Cross-Application Components  \n  → Document Compliance  \n  → eDocument Cockpit  \n  → Maintain Actions\n\nFill the fields:\n\n  Action                   : ZMY_ACTION  \n  Description              : My new validation action  \n  Implementation Class     : ZCL_EDOC_ACTION_XXX  \n  Exec. Type               : 1 (User) or 2 (Background)  \n  Simulation Possible?     : X (if you coded EXECUTE_SIMULATE)  \n  Data Exchange Method     : (Only if you want to link an HTTP / RFC\n                             destination – otherwise leave blank)  \n  RFC/HTTP Destination     : (Optional)  \n  Log. System / BAdI etc.  : Only if required  \n\nSave and transport the entry.\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n4. Assign the action to the custom process step\n--------------------------------------------------\nIMG path:\n  Cross-Application Components  \n  → Document Compliance  \n  → eDocument Cockpit  \n  → Maintain Process Definition\n\n1. Select your custom Process ID (ZPROCESS).  \n2. Go to the “Process Steps” node; create or pick the step to which the\n   new action belongs (e.g. ZSTEP_VALIDATE).  \n3. In the “Assigned Actions” sub-view add ZMY_ACTION and set the\n   execution sequence number (the lower the number, the earlier it is\n   offered).  \n4. Indicate whether the action is\n   – startable from cockpit,\n   – startable in background job,\n   – relevant for cancellation, etc.\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n5. Expose the action in the UI (cockpit button)\n--------------------------------------------------\n1. Call transaction /EDOCUMENT/CUST_UI  (or table maintenance view\n   V_EDOC_UI_ACTN).  \n2. Create an entry for:\n   – Process ID   : ZPROCESS  \n   – Action       : ZMY_ACTION  \n   – Button Text  : Validate  \n   – Icon         : sap-icon://check  \n   – Sequence     : 40 (decides where the button appears)  \n3. Save and transport.\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n6. Authorisation\n--------------------------------------------------\nAdd the action to the authorisation object EDOC_ACT (or the role used in\nPFCG) so that the end-user can execute it.\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n7. Testing\n--------------------------------------------------\n1. Create or pick a business document that is linked to your\n   eDocument-process and generate the eDocument.  \n2. Open the Fiori app “eDocument Cockpit” (or transaction EDOC_COCKPIT).  \n3. Highlight the document → new button “Validate” (or whatever text you\n   chose) should be visible.  \n4. Execute the action.  \n5. Check:\n   – Cockpit status column.  \n   – Application log (SLG1 object EDOC).  \n   – Messages returned by your ABAP class.  \n6. If it should run in background schedule program\n   /EDOCUMENT/PROC_ACTION with parameter ZMY_ACTION.\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n8. Transport\n--------------------------------------------------\n• ABAP class → transport request via SE09 / CTS project.  \n• All IMG entries are recorded in a workbench request automatically.\n• Move the transport to Q and P tenants as usual.\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n9. Maintenance hints\n--------------------------------------------------\n• Never modify SAP delivered actions.  \n• Use the same action ID for all countries but separate logic inside the\n  class if really necessary.  \n• If you need to enhance the mapping or the XML structure involved in\n  your action you can still call the SAP mapping APIs from inside the\n  class or implement BAdI EDOC_ADJUST_XML.  \n• Keep every custom development in customer namespace; this guarantees\n  that future SAP upgrades in your private cloud tenant remain\n  conflict-free.\n\nBy following the nine steps above you have officially “extended” the\neDocument Action framework for your own process in S/4HANA Cloud, private\nedition.",

         "Short answer  \nNo – neither the “Manage Electronic Documents” Fiori app (F1671/F1984) nor the legacy Web-Dynpro “eDocument Cockpit” can be enhanced with additional fields in SAP S/4HANA Cloud, private edition. SAP has deliberately locked these compliance-relevant UIs against key-user or developer UI extensions.  \n\nWhy this restriction exists  \n1. Legal compliance – The apps belong to the “SAP Document Compliance” framework. SAP must guarantee that every delivered screen, field and process stays consistent with the country-specific legal templates shipped in Support Packages.  \n2. No Business Context – In the Custom Fields & Logic tool there is no “eDocument” (EDOC) business context. Without a context you cannot create a custom field that can be switched on for the app.  \n3. UI adaptation flag – Both apps are shipped with the “UI adaptation not allowed” flag. Hence Visual Adaptation, Adapt UI, Web-Dynpro configuration, or UI5 flexibility changes are rejected.  \n4. Modification versus extensibility – Private-edition does allow modifications, but any change in SAP namespace would put the system into “modified” status, break the compliance content and make all future SP/SFP updates a manual retrofit. SAP therefore does not support it.\n\nWhat you still CAN do  \n• Add your own fields to the electronic document payload by means of the provided eDocument BAdIs (e.g. EDOC_ADAPTOR_BADI, EDOC_OUTPUT_MAPPING, etc.) so the legal XML / IDoc / PEPPOL message receives the extra data.  \n• Build your own custom report/Fiori app that reads the EDOC_* tables or the CDS View I_ElectronicDocument to display your additional fields next to the SAP data.  \n• Use standard extensibility (CFL, CDS view extension, custom APIs) for the originating business object (billing document, purchase order, etc.), not for the cockpit itself.\n\nBottom line  \nIn S/4HANA Cloud, private edition the standard cockpit UIs are fixed; you may not insert, hide or rearrange fields in them. Any additional business information has to be handled outside the cockpit (via BAdIs, custom reports or custom Fiori apps).",

         "The generated answer is partially helpful in addressing the question about controlling the visibility of Electronic Documents with custom fields in Private Cloud using DRC extensibility. Here's the reasoning:\n\n1. Accuracy: The generated answer correctly states that DRC extensibility can be used to create additional header/item fields, fill those fields using BAdIs, and map them to XML/JSON/PDF sent to tax authorities. This aligns with the information from the SAP documentation summary.\n\n2. Visibility Control: The answer correctly mentions that the standard visibility of electronic documents is controlled by normal SAP authorization objects evaluating standard fields. This is consistent with the information from both sources.\n\n3. Custom Fields and Visibility: The generated answer states that custom fields added through DRC-extensibility BAdIs cannot be used to hide or show documents. However, the SAP documentation summary suggests that there are some capabilities for controlling visibility using custom fields, at least in the Public Cloud environment.\n\n4. Private Cloud Specifics: The generated answer doesn't differentiate between Private Cloud and Public Cloud capabilities, which is a limitation. The SAP Help lookup also doesn't provide specific information about Private Cloud, but it does mention that the extensibility options are applicable to both cloud and on-premise environments, including private cloud deployments.\n\n5. Alternative Solutions: The answer provides alternative solutions, such as using existing authorization objects or developing a custom CDS view/Fiori list report. While these suggestions are reasonable, they don't fully explore the extensibility options mentioned in the SAP Help lookup, such as RAP business object extensions or service definition extensions.\n\n6. Omissions: The answer doesn't mention some of the extensibility capabilities outlined in the SAP Help lookup, such as the Custom Function interface or the ability to extend the Manage Electronic Documents app (F4306).\n\nIn conclusion, while the generated answer provides some accurate information and alternative solutions, it doesn't fully capture the extensibility capabilities available in SAP S/4HANA, particularly in the context of Private Cloud. It also makes a definitive statement about the inability to control visibility using custom fields, which may not be entirely accurate given the information from the SAP documentation summary about visibility control in CDS-based UIs.",

         "No – at the moment the DRC (Document and Reporting Compliance) extensibility framework can only be used to\n\n• create additional header / item fields,  \n• fill those fields by means of the supplied BAdIs, and  \n• map them to the XML / JSON / PDF that is sent to the tax authority,\n\nbut it cannot be used to influence the authorisation logic or the selection logic of the standard Fiori apps (for example “Monitor Electronic Documents”).\n\nThe visibility of electronic documents that are shown in the DRC monitor is still controlled exclusively by the normal SAP authorisation objects that evaluate standard fields such as company code, business place, tax country, authorisation group, etc.  \nCustom fields you add by means of the DRC-extensibility BAdIs are not evaluated by those authorisation objects and therefore cannot be used to hide or show documents.\n\nIf you need document visibility based on a custom attribute you have to:\n\n1. Stay with the standard monitor and restrict access only with the existing authorisation objects,  \n2. or develop your own CDS view / Fiori list report in which you filter on the custom field and assign that app to the relevant business roles.\n\nSo, strictly speaking, DRC extensibility does not provide a way to control the visibility of electronic documents through custom fields in an S/4HANA Private Cloud system.",
